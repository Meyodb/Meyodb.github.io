                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>Dig out your old iPod and fire up your ‘Songs to cry to’ playlist, I come bearing sad news. After more than 15 years covering everything Apple, it’s with a heavy heart I announce that we will no longer be publishing new content on iMore.</p><p>I want to kick off by thanking you all for your support over the many years and incarnations of the site. Whether you were a day-one early adopter in the ‘PhoneDifferent’ days, came on board with ‘The iPhone Blog,’ or recently started reading to find out what the hell Apple Vision Pro is, it’s been a privilege to serve you a daily slice of Apple pie.</p><p>Launching in the wake of the very first iPhone back in 2008, a game-changing device not just for Apple but the world at large, it’s somewhat fitting that we wrap publication here in 2024 on the precipice of the launch of a new industry-shifting technology from Apple in the shape of Apple Intelligence. Just as Apple wasn’t the first company to make a smartphone, it’s not the first to test the waters of artificial intelligence, either — but just as the iPhone became world-conquering, so too may Apple Intelligence reshape the way we interact with technology for years to come.</p><p>It’s a keen reminder that the world of technology never stands still: The term ‘artificial intelligence’ was the reserve of science fiction in the early days of the iPhone. The world of publishing is forever evolving too, as do the forms of technology journalism that look to shine a light on the industry. iMore leaves the stage at a pivotal crossroads for online publishing, where the battle for readers&apos; time and attention is more demanding than ever before, and the aforementioned AI advances and search discovery methods further complicate the playing field. It’s been a joy to serve such a passionate readership over the years, but it’s time to pass the baton to new writers, new sites, and new formats.</p><p>I would like to take this moment to thank everyone from the iMore community, past and present, for their support and passion for what we’ve created over the years. A massive thanks goes to iMore’s previous leaders, Lory Gil, Serenity Caldwell, and Joe Keller, and of course, the inimitable Rene Ritchie who kickstarted this wonder all those years back. I hope we’ve done you all proud. </p><p>I’d like to give a particular shout out to the final iMore team that I’ve worked most closely with, and that has been an honor to lead over the past few years: Stephen, Tammy, John-Anthony, Daryl, and James, as well as our many regular contributors — thanks for putting a smile on my face each and every day. I can’t wait to see what you all do next. </p><p>iMore will stay online so readers can continue to access articles from the archive, and the forum at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.imore.com/" target="_blank">https://forums.imore.com/</a> will remain active until November 1 to serve our community. Our sister sites TechRadar.com and TomsGuide.com will also continue to publish all the latest news, reviews, and more from the world of Apple-based computing, while our buddies at WindowsCentral.com and AndroidCentral.com have the privilege of continuing to serve you class-leading news, reviews and features from the other side of the tech fence, keeping you up to date with the latest from Microsoft and Google.</p><p>Now it’s time to close those Watch rings, put a gag on Siri, and guzzle down<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ibeer-drink-from-your-phone/id475905823"><u> the iBeer app</u></a> one last time. Thanks for letting us think different for all these years. We’ll see you in the great iCloud backup in the sky.</p><p><strong>—Gerald and the iMore team</strong></p>

The word translates to “Sword Saint,” and it is the relentless commitment to being the best that iFi channeled into the masterfully crafted product that is the iFi Kensei. </p><p>This is truly a tool for the audiophile, so without getting too deep into the weeds, we’re going to get a bit more technical in this review than normal, with an eye on keeping it accessible.</p>

<p>The iFi GO bar Kensei is available from ifi-audio.com, Amazon and other online retailers like Sweetwater, for $449. Unlike the iFi Gold bar, this is not a limited run and will be around for a while according to an iFi rep’s comments on a HiFi user forum sponsored by iFi.</p>

<p>Unboxing the Kensei is an experience. It’s set in a beautiful, environmentally friendly, carved wooden box. You get two premium braided cables (USB-C, USB-C to Lightning with USB-A adapter) and a leather pouch. No bigger than a USB flash drive, the GO bar Kensei is made with Japanese stainless steel and is deceptively heavy for its size. Its body has chamfered edges and feels premium all the way around, though it does attract fingerprints like a magnet. It has branding beautifully etched into the underside of the bar, but the face is where it gets exciting.</p>

<p>On the face, you’ll find a panel with LEDs that indicate volume level, audio format, frequency, and sound effects. The right side is where you’ll find the volume and settings push buttons, as well as the IEMatch switch. The top of the device is where the 3.5mm and 4.4mm headphone outputs are found, and the bottom is where you’ll find the USB-C input, which supports up to 32-bit/384kHz audio.</p><p>The Go bar Kensei gets a bit warm during use, but not uncomfortably. Though it is dense and has good heft, the stainless steel is a bit soft when it comes to external wear and will show scratches and scuffs.</p>

<p>The GO bar Kensei uses a 32-bit Cirrus Logic DAC chipset with Hi-Res <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://ifi-audio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/iDAC2-Spilling-the-Sauce-2-of-6_-9-Nov-2015.pdf">True Native</a>® playback of music formats from MP3 to DSD256, PCM384, and DXD384. You also get full MQA decoding. The Kensei is chock full of high-end capacitors, which give you a clean signal, reduce potential distortion, and have premium noise-reduction capabilities. You can read about those in detail here.</p><p>The stars of the show are the four digital filters and two analog modes. The modes and their corresponding LEDs are:</p><p>Bit-Perfect (cyan) I ran this with the Sennheiser IE900 IEMs, and it was bright without sibilance and transparent. This one gives you your Hi-Res or lossless audio just as it was intended.</p><p>Standard (red) came across as “smooth,” with warmth in the vocals instead of brightness.</p><p>Minimum phase (yellow) is warmer but with tight bass. If you’re a basshead, this is the filter for you. Use it with the XBass filter turned on and the K2HD filter activated, and you’ll get kick-you-in-the-face bass with no loss of mids and vocal clarity.</p><p>Gibbs Transient-Optimised (white) upsamples your audio to 352/384kHz. I’d just describe this one as “energetic” overall. You’ll feel it across the frequency range.</p>

<p>The Kensei goes a long way to <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/beats-solo-4-playing-a-tune-made-for-apple-lossless">make sure every headphone </a>or IEM you plug up is treated well with their IEMatch switch, which reduces output for high-sensitivity IEMs like the Campfire Audio Mammoths I played with, and their Turbo Mode, which does the opposite and increases gain by 6dB to drive power hungry headphones like the HiFiMan Planar magnetics I used. It isn’t like the Kensei lacks the power to drive what you throw at it, with 477mW or 7.2V out of the 4.4mm output and 300mW or 8V  out of the 3.5 S-Balanced output. </p><p>Regarding volume level output, you can control source audio from the Kensei in sync with the source device or bypass the source device’s audio controls altogether. </p><p>The downside to all of the amazing power unleashed upon your ears is that you’ll experience a decent amount of battery drain from your phones and tablets since that’s what powers the Kensei via that USB-C port. Your laptops won’t be as noticeable since they have larger batteries, and you can easily charge while listening, but that drain is there. There is no internal battery here like the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/ifi-go-blu-review">iFi GO blu</a>. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-go-bar-kensei-sound-quality"><span>iFi GO bar Kensei: Sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="E9RusmkJaHCnhEnBhdxaxX" name="ifi-go-bar-kensei-iphone-iems.jpg" alt="iFi GO bar Kensei" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/E9RusmkJaHCnhEnBhdxaxX.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The “Sword Saint” produces audio that is, in a word, “ethereal” but full-bodied. It’s all there. The sound quality out of both the 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports is effortless, with beautiful musicality.</p><p>This transparent DAC/Amp allows you to enjoy every nuance of a stereo image. Pair the Kensei with analytical headphones or IEMs, and it’s like turning on a floodlight in a large space previously lit by a small 40-watt bulb. That’s exactly what I experienced when I plugged Sennheieser’s IE900 IEMs into the 4.4mm balanced output with the bit-perfect digital filter. </p><p>Listening to “Violin Duel” from the Chevalier OST was illuminating. You could hear artifacts and nuances I’d previously missed. The tension of the bow against the violin strings. The attack on the chord changes, whereas before, I really only heard the attack in different movements. Same with Beyonce’s “Texas Hold ‘Em” where the plucking of the banjo and guitars, still layered toward the back, was richly detailed.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="fEsq4f3NMC7LBVv2kWTrYY" name="ifi-go-bar-kensei-closeup-lifestyle.jpg" alt="iFi GO bar Kensei" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/fEsq4f3NMC7LBVv2kWTrYY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>When it comes to bass and sub-bass, the transparency really shows how a track was engineered. The IE900 isn’t a bass-heavy IEM, but its 7mm dynamic drivers can energetically play back deep, dark bass via PEQ or digital filter tuning, as was the case with iFi’s XBass filter activated. Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and “Start A Riot” from the Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse soundtrack both growled and rumbled with enough authority and aggression that they had me making the “stank face” while bobbing my head to that nasty bass and sub-bass. That led me down the rabbit hole of sampling a dozen or so hip-hop tracks with this IEM/DAC filter combo.</p><p>What’s important here is that the digital filters I mentioned in the features section may make your music sound even better depending on which IEMs or headphones you’ve paired to the Kensei. For example, I ran the $120 1MORE Penta Driver IEMs, which don’t have nearly the level of transparency of the IE900, but with the K2HD, XBass, and XSpace filters activated, they open up and give the listening experience quite a bit more than what their default tuning offers.</p>

<p>The GO bar Kensei is unique in that it is more like a collector’s edition DAC, with its ornate box, accessories, and fit and finish. In this price point, there are however competitors with various feature offerings. Fiio makes excellent products and the Q15 may be a better fit for some folks’ listening habits as it has a built-in IPS display and a Bluetooth SoC, giving you access to wireless hi-res audio connectivity.</p><p>Then there’s the iBasso DC-Elite, which I tried unsuccessfully to get my hands on for a separate review. It has a feature set that matches closely the Kensei, and a design that is eye-catching. On paper, it appears to be a worthy competitor and is generally regarded as a solid piece of kit.</p>

<p>The GO bar Kensie is transparent without being harsh or overly smooth. It pairs perfectly with musical IEMs, it&apos;s digital filters give you greater options as you pair it with different headphones or IEMs and the analog processing modes XBass Plus and XSpace breathe new bass and sub-bass life into open-back over-ears. All of this while efficiently driving everything I’ve thrown at it, even though that comes at the cost of your mobile audio source’s battery life.</p><p>This DAC/Amp will be pricey for casual music consumers. For audio hobbyists, it is feature-rich and built like a tank, so it should give you years of listening pleasure on the go.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>It is said that we “eat with our eyes.” Do we also listen with them? People seem to place a lot of stock in how an audio product looks, which makes Fiio’s KA11 a delicious auditory dish that will satiate your Hi-Res audio hunger. </p><p>Sure, you can buy Apple’s 3.5mm to Lighting/USB-C dongle for around $9 but as your tastes and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/focal-bathys-review-the-french-masterwork">headphone or IEM collection grow</a>, it may not be enough to drive your new toys and that’s where the $29 KA11 comes in.</p>

<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-price-and-availability"><span>Fiio KA11: Price and availability</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="YpRs2CVFrnqa3tJnY5Li44" name="fiio-ka11.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YpRs2CVFrnqa3tJnY5Li44.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The KA11 is available for $29 through their site and Amazon.com. You can get it in two colors, black and a fun silver and teal combo, with your choice of either a USB-C or Lightning connector for those with phones older than an iPhone 15.</p><p>Other than the Apple Lightning or USB-C dongle, which will cost you $9, this is one of the most inexpensive DACs on the market and also the most powerful at this price point.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-build-and-fit"><span>Fiio KA11: Build and fit</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hEGThL4hYZZRHaWmvavRm5" name="fiio-ka11-braided-cord.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hEGThL4hYZZRHaWmvavRm5.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Fiio’s KA11 weighs in at only 8.5 grams and is built with high quality components for its $29 price point. The body of the DAC is composed of an aluminum-magnesium alloy, so you won’t have to baby it when you’re headed out the door and tossing your EDC items into your favorite bag.</p><p>The cable carrying your sound is equally well-appointed and durable. Wrapped in a layer of silicone with braided cloth on the outside, it consists of high-purity, oxygen-free palladium-plated copper wires that go between your connector of choice and the DAC. </p><p>The cable features rubber or silicone connector caps, adding to the overall feeling of durability and the connectors themselves don’t feel loose when plugging and unplugging. Connections on both ends are tight, and 3.5mm headphone connectors have that satisfying click when plugging in.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-features"><span>Fiio KA11: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="o9MHZyGwHwJ34wC5krjE95" name="fiio-ka11-hifiman-lifestyle.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/o9MHZyGwHwJ34wC5krjE95.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The most powerful feature (pun intended) of the KA11 is the power delivery which drove even the most sensitive pair of planar magnetic headphones I own. The single-ended 3.5mm port delivers up to 245mW of power per channel at 16ohms, and 200mW at 32ohms. The Cirrus Logic CS43131 DAC chip decodes DSD256, and up to 384kHz/32-bit files over PCM. The SG-Micro SGM8262 amp is what’s inside, driving thirsty IEMs. </p><p>An LED on the 3.5mm port end of the dongle body tells you the sampling rate. DSD decoding gets a green light, and tracks above or below 48kHz get a yellow or blue light, respectively.</p><p>The good news is that you can control those LEDs and digital filters through the FIIO Control app. The bad news is that it’s only on Android.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-sound-quality"><span>Fiio KA11: Sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="e6ahBuo5EBVu5dX5AEQQX6" name="fiio-ka11-iems.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/e6ahBuo5EBVu5dX5AEQQX6.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Now we’ll talk about the most important aspect of the KA11, the sound. I listened to the KA11 using several over-ear headphones and IEMs, and for $29, its ability to drive my HiFiMan HE4XX planar magnetic headphones was impressive. My iPhone 15 Pro Max only needed to be turned up to 75% of their max for a comfortable listening experience. My Campfire Audio Mammoth IEMs are quite sensitive, and the KA11, with its best-in-class power output, handled them expertly. The power output of the KA11s meant that the comfortable listening level was around 15% of the max. Sennheiser’s $1500 IE900 IEMs were a delight to experience through the KA11, only needing to be turned up to 33% of the max volume of the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Okay, technically, those notes weren’t about sound but power. The KA11 is well-balanced in its sound profile. You’ll get a bit of warmth through the mids, but vocals shine through, and bass and sub-bass are an enjoyable element of the sonic feast without overpowering the other “flavor notes.” The soundstage isn’t the most expansive <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-dacs-iphone-and-ipad">I’ve experienced from a DAC</a>, but it is still large enough that your airy tracks shouldn’t feel constricted. </p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-competition"><span>Fiio KA11: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1280px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:117.19%;"><img id="RhpxABdWAt39L3x8v6QqJo" name="benfei-dac-ka11-competition.jpg" alt="Benfei dongle DAC" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/RhpxABdWAt39L3x8v6QqJo.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1280" height="1500" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Benfei)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Some DACs on Amazon compete on price with the KA11, but nothing at $30 competes on power output or performance. This DAC&apos;s output rivals products that can cost hundreds of dollars more.</p><p>So, does the Fiio KA11 have competition? The short answer is, no.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-fiio-ka11-should-you-buy-it"><span>Fiio KA11: Should you buy it?</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Nvkjb43tpZURQD6Htr5Ub4" name="fiio-ka11-hero16x9.jpg" alt="Fiio KA11" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Nvkjb43tpZURQD6Htr5Ub4.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You should buy the Fiio KA11 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>Cost is your primary purchasing consideration</li><li>You have power-hungry headphones or IEMs</li><li>You want an EDC DAC you can just throw in a bag and go</li><li>You’re new to Hi-Res or Lossless mobile audio</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Fiio KA11 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have the budget to spend $100-$300</li></ul>
<p>Look no further if you want a powerful DAC that won’t overpower your bank account balance. This is it, full stop. Fiio’s KA11 is a USB-C or Lightning-connected DAC capable of driving most of the headphones or IEMs in your stable, featuring a sound profile balanced enough not to add significant unnecessary color to your listening experience.</p><p>When you enter audiophile land, there are many areas where you’ll spend your discretionary income, but this need not be one at the outset. Focus on headphone or IEM costs first, then sit back and enjoy them with the KA11.</p>

Keeping an eye out when you aren’t home? Maybe it’s to keep an eye out while you sleep? This camera does it all with enough detail to really make a difference if, heaven forbid, you ever need evidence of a break-in or have a pet emergency. Let’s dig into the Tapo TC73!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tapo-tc73-price-and-availability"><span>Tapo TC73: Price and availability</span></h3>

<p>Tapo’s TC73 is widely available online and in brick-and-mortar stores. Right now, it can be purchased for $50 at places like Best Buy or Amazon.com. It was at its highest price in January 2024, at $70, but it seems to have price dips every couple of months or so, bringing it back to the $50 price point.</p><p>Its pricing aligns with one of our other favorite pan-and-tilt indoor security cameras, Aqara’s E1. The TC73 comes in only one color, white and black, with a red stripe toward the bottom.</p>

<p>I’ve been on a HomeKit Secure Video kick lately, looking at various cameras and accessories. The Tapo TC73 is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/every-security-camera-homekit-secure-video-support">one of the best cameras</a> I’ve had the privilege of reviewing. The 2K QHD 4MP video is bright, with true colors and plenty of detail in darkness and daylight. That was even before I activated the HDR function, which increases dynamic range and enhances image quality in the shadows and highlights (areas that may be “blown out” due to light streaming through a window). If 2688x1520 (2K QHD) is too much for your available video bandwidth, you can scale the video down to 720P, saving space on the optional microSD card you can use to store videos locally. Another great option for keeping the bandwidth usable for your setup is the ability to switch video frame rates. You can choose from 15fps, 20fps, 25fps, and 30fps. </p><p>With all of the high-resolution things activated, I noticed my stream going from around 160KB/s with no activity in front of the camera to around 350KB/s when I walked in front of it, looking at the app to note bandwidth changes. Those numbers are based on your motion settings before recording kicks in. </p>

<p>The camera has more options than many of its competitors when it comes to motion and sound settings. You get the usual unspecified motion, then specific person/pet/vehicle options, but add to that “Line-Crossing Detection” and ‘Camera Tampering.” The former allows you to set a boundary in a location and get notified anytime a person or object crosses the boundary from either side. The latter sends you a notification when someone attempts to obstruct the camera and comes with sensitivity settings. You can also set the built-in alarm to go off when obstruction/tampering is identified.</p><p>As I said, there are sound detection options aplenty. A crying baby, glass breaking, dog(s) barking, and even cat meows will trigger alerts. I tested them all with YouTube sound effects, and they worked—well, except for the glass-breaking detection. But that could be based on the types of sound effects I’d found. And I love ya’ll, but I&apos;m not breaking my windows to test that for you.</p><p>Speaking of breaking, if someone does break in at night, you have two options that may help you identify a thief. The TC73 features a starlight sensor, giving you better night visibility. It’s a larger sensor that captures more light, but the camera unit also comes with two IR lights to illuminate further what you’re trying to protect: red and blue. What’s the difference? Blue light is practically imperceptible, but the trade-off is the visible distance from the camera in the dark. If you’re only using the camera to watch a baby or pet, it’s ideal for that. The red light allows you to see further in the dark, up to 30 feet from the camera but is visible at night.</p><p>There’s native HKSV support built in here, so you can go and add it to Apple Home once you have everything configured the way you like in the Tapo app. Of course, that means lower resolution video and most of its features are unavailable in Apple’s app, including the built-in alarm, which does get exposed in Apple Home with some security cameras. With Tapo, besides the camera itself, you get the motion sensor exposed so that you can configure automations with it—something I’d like to have been able to do with the alarm.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="deaw64TRei2MeCZpfEVBgC" name="tapo-tc73-privacy-button.jpg" alt="Tapo TC73 pan/tilt AI Security Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/deaw64TRei2MeCZpfEVBgC.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="caption-text">Close up of the physical privacy button </span><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>I like the camera unit&apos;s looks, though some might find it large-ish for their use. At almost 5 inches tall by 3 inches wide, compared to others,† it isn’t inconspicuous. Recently, my younger brother visited the house and noticed it, telling me I had HAL9000 in my living room. That’s because the red status LED is pretty bright, but you can deactivate that if you want the unit to be more discreet.</p><p>The unit does feel substantial, though not heavy. It can be mounted upside down, with an inversion option in the Tapo App 3.0 menu. It is powered by a 12V DC adapter and connects to your network via 2.4GHz Wi-Fi only; there is no ethernet port.</p><p>I have noticed that the pan and tilt motor, and the AI which drives it are the most responsive I’ve used so far. The TC73 does a fantastic job of keeping up with people and pets moving in front of the camera’s lens.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tapo-tc73-ease-of-use"><span>Tapo TC73: Ease of use</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="gzemZWqu2aKWJPD3Mvd8oA" name="tapo-tc73-app-menus.jpg" alt="Tapo TC73 pan/tilt AI Security Camera" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/gzemZWqu2aKWJPD3Mvd8oA.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the TC73 version two was quite simple. Download the Tapo app, create a login, tap the “+,” look for your device, and follow the prompts. Some of those will be voice prompts, letting you know you’re connected to the network or finished with setup. It took me roughly five minutes to get it up and running.</p><p>Because the app’s camera settings are laid out intuitively, using its extensive features is easy. You can access all of the camera’s settings from two screens: the main home screen for the TC73 and through the settings cog on that home screen. From the main screen, you get the pan and tilt function, privacy mode, alarm on/off, screenshotting, video recording, two-way communications, and playback and download of events. </p><p>The other settings are behind a cog in the upper right-hand corner of the screen. I really like the way that the screen is organized. It uses cards and a menu list. The privacy options there are easy to use. I really like that they’ve included a privacy occlusion option and that the lens privacy option is in the app and can be activated via a physical button on the face of the camera body. Both options rotate the lens so it’s facing inside the camera body, giving physical privacy and not an app-based “blackout.”</p>

<p>Right now, the HKSV options you have are Aqara’s E1, and Camera Hub G3, as well as Eufy’s Indoor Cam E220 and Netatmo’s Smart Indoor Camera. </p><p>Aqara’s E1 and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/eufy-indoor-cam-pan-2k-review">Eufy’s E220</a> fall in line price-wise with the TC73, while the Netatmo offering is $190 and the Hub G3 is $88. Netamo’s Smart Indoor Camera is much more expensive than the TC73, but on its face, it appears to offer a similar feature set. I haven’t had my hands on that one yet though, so I can’t really compare it. Of the several cameras I have had the opportunity to review, Tapo’s has the best-looking video so far. That said, it doesn’t compare line-by-line to Aqara’s Camera Hub G3 as that one has a built-in Zigbee hub. The saving grace there is that the hub only connects to other Aqara products.</p><p>Right now, I would not recommend any other HKSV-supported pan and tilt camera over the TC73, but we’ll keep you updated as new devices come onto the market.</p>

<ul><li>You want detailed, high resolution video</li><li>You want a great value</li><li>You want a pan and tilt camera with HKSV support</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Tapo TC73 if...</strong></p>

<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-tapo-tc73-verdict"><span>Tapo TC73: Verdict</span></h3>
<p>There is so much to cover with Tapo’s TC73! You can even watch your video directly through a PC with RTSP support, which also means that you can connect that video recording to a NAS. And we haven’t even gone into all of the products you can connect it to with TP-Link’s Kasa line of products or other Tapo products.  There’s a lot to offer here with the TC73’s high-quality night and day video, fluid pan and tilt that keeps with the action in front of the lens, smart privacy options, and an intuitively laid out Tapo App 3.0.</p><p>All of that combines to make Tapo’s TC73 easy to recommend for any shopper looking for an HKSV-supported pan and tilt camera that has plenty of compatible accessories to build your own smart home.</p>

<p>The Video Doorbell G4 is available only through Amazon for $120. At the time that I’m writing this there is an instant $22 discount coupon you can clip to apply to your purchase. It is currently available only in the U.S.</p><p>The G4 is priced below competitors like Arlo, Ring, or Nest, and doesn’t require a subscription for video recording, as the repeater features expandable storage for local recording. So you’ll save a few dollars compared to competing products. It’s important to note that for a few extra dollars, some competing products offer a vertically wider field of view, and slightly higher video resolution.</p><p>The G4 is available in either black, or shadow gray.</p>

<p>Aqara’s Video Doorbell G4 is powered by six AA batteries, which can be standard or rechargeable, but will last up to four months depending on how often activity is triggered. The G4 can also be wired to an AC/DC transformer like some of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/every-security-camera-homekit-secure-video-support">best video doorbells available</a>. The video is 1080p with a 162-degree field of view, but in my testing, I found that I’d like it to have a greater vertical field of view. I have it positioned pretty low on my door, as you&apos;ll see in the ultra-wide shot of my patio below. At that level, I can see as tall as a 6’ person’s head, but I can’t see the ground, so when packages are placed at my door, they’re out of view.</p>

<p>This is also due to the way my front porch is set up. It’s pretty narrow, so if you have a larger front porch, you’ll get more of the person in view as they approach the camera. You won’t likely see a package on the ground if it’s placed too close to your door though.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="wKis5hDZK6yYRcypDMFv3S" name="aqara-video-doorbell-g4-patio-wide.jpg" alt="Aqara Smart Video Doorbell G4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wKis5hDZK6yYRcypDMFv3S.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The G4 has some nifty AI and privacy features, like on-device facial recognition. Using the Aqara Home app, you can answer the doorbell using an “Uncle”, robot, or clown voice. Another handy privacy feature is the ability to mask areas of the image that may contain sensitive or unwanted views of neighbors&apos; apartments or homes.</p><p>The repeater and doorbell units are both single-band 2.4GHz b/g/n only. While the doorbell can be powered by batteries or wired, with batteries used as a backup, the repeater must be connected to an external power supply via USB-C connection. The repeater also supports local storage up to 512GB via microSD card, which will allow you to set up 24/7 recording without needing an internet connection or the cloud. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="9kd8kBaaf5pndRAkBVkZtT" name="aqara-video-doorbell-g4-microSD.jpg" alt="Aqara Smart Video Doorbell G4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/9kd8kBaaf5pndRAkBVkZtT.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The repeater/chime is actually pretty full-featured. It features a loud 95dB speaker, which is great for the custom ringtones you can set up with it. You can use facial recognition to trigger those custom tones based on who’s at the door. It can also be set up with other automation to act as an alarm. Say, if you have other Aqara products like the window sensors and someone breaks into that window.</p>

<p>The G4 will likely evoke strong emotions from different users for its looks. While some folks like the svelte styling of the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/arlo-video-doorbell-review">Arlo video doorbell</a>, the Aqara G4 is larger and boxier like the Ring doorbell. Its doorbell button which lights up via LEDs, and its camera module are large and obvious, nothing discreet about it.</p><p>The G4 feels substantial and is IP-rated, though the instruction manual recommends placing it on a porch or other shaded area. It’s available in two colors, both dark tones only. If you’re in an apartment and can’t permanently alter your front door, or swap out the doorbell, this unit fits into one of my favorite temporary mounts, the Doorbell Boa. It’s a tight fit through the face of the Boa due to the large buttons on the face of the G4, but it works with minimal hassle.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-video-doorbell-g4-ease-of-use"><span>Aqara Video Doorbell G4: Ease of use</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Y7DsqRg9UN8DBTefeWv2QQ" name="aqara-video-doorbell-g4-aqara-home-app.JPG" alt="Aqara Smart Video Doorbell G4" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Y7DsqRg9UN8DBTefeWv2QQ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the Video Doorbell G4 was a breeze. There are QR codes for downloading the Aqara Home app and for binding to HomeKit. The repeater is the part that connects to your home router, while the actual doorbell unit connects to it. So, you’ll set up the repeater first by adding it to the Aqara Home app, and following the prompts. </p><p>I recommend setting everything up in Aqara Home first, and then connecting to Apple Home because there are a lot of features worth using that aren’t exposed to HomeKit. Once you configure features like image masking or custom ringtones, you can access and use the G4 through Apple’s Home app.</p><p>One aspect that doesn’t get enough attention is how easy it is to use most of these HKSV-supported cameras with your Apple Watch. The folks in Cupertino, CA, deserve their flowers for creating devices whose connectedness is pretty solid across hardware. I love being out and about and looking at the Home app on my Apple Watch to see who’s at the door. I can even control speaker volume and talk directly through the watch to anyone at the door.</p>

<p>There is some solid competition in the connected doorbell space, but Aqara’s offering stands out because of its value. You get a lot of features for less money than you would with competitors.</p><p>If you need a wider front porch view, you can look at the Nest doorbell cam. I’ve used it, and the view is excellent. As tight as the space is in front of my door, I can see an entire person and packages on the ground. The catch, though, is that it does not support HomeKit. Belkin’s Wemo brand has its compact Smart Doorbell Camera, which does support HomeKit, though I’ve not yet had the chance to test it out. It comes with a larger field of view <em>and</em> price tag, almost double the cost.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-video-doorbell-g4-should-you-buy-it"><span>Aqara Video Doorbell G4: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy the Aqara Video Doorbell G4 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a great doorbell at a fair price</li><li>You want a battery-operated doorbell cam</li><li>You want a lot of customization options</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Aqara Video Doorbell G4 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You need a wider field of view</li><li>You don’t want to deal with a two-piece unit</li></ul>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-video-doorbell-g4-verdict"><span>Aqara Video Doorbell G4: Verdict</span></h3>
<p>Like I said earlier, I haven’t tested the Wemo offering yet, but of those I have tested, this is in the running for the best of show! The Aqara Video Doorbell G4 gives you a wealth of customizations, some very cool privacy features, and most importantly, solid video performance with timely notifications. If you’re all in on the HomeKit ecosystem, you may want to go all in on Aqara, and it’s video doorbell.</p>

I have only one minor complaint. We’ll touch on that shortly. </p>

<p>Aqara’s Camera Hub G3 is one of their best indoor cameras, but if you’re invested in the Apple ecosystem, an Aqara hub may not be what you’re after. That’s where the Indoor Security Camera E1 comes in. For $50 less, you get much of what the G3 offers and some updated features in a smaller 4-inch tall package.</p><p>The E1 supports Wi-Fi 6, while the Camera Hub G3 is Wi-Fi 5. The E1 ups the G3’s robust privacy features by adding masking zones. You can add a black block to your video feed, so those areas are literally blacked out. That is in addition to an automated privacy mode, which allows you to set specific times when the camera will pan and point toward a wall or other privacy-focused area. The privacy options are a great feature because you will see everything pretty clearly with this 2K, f/2.0 camera, which looks great in good lighting and low-light conditions.</p>

However, you can also record locally because it has a microSD slot for up to 512GB of local video storage. This is especially useful if you turn on the camera’s 24-hour recording with timelapse mode. Accessing that slot is simple; just slide the camera&apos;s tilt lens up, revealing a microSD slot at the bottom of it.</p><p>One of the features I loved playing with is the 2-way telecom system. There&apos;s a speaker and microphone built into the E1 so you can use it as a telecom to talk to whoever&apos;s on the other side of the image. Your kids, your significant other, your pet, talk to everyone!</p>

<p>The Camera E1 feels well-built, even though it’s primarily plastic. It’s tiny, measuring 4 inches tall by 2.68 inches wide, so it should easily fit on a bookcase shelf or most other locations. It can even be mounted to the ceiling, and then you can go into the Aqara Home app and reorient the video.</p><p>The camera stays out of the way with an infrared backlight, which you won’t notice during lights out if this is in a bedroom. The motor is whisper quiet, so you’ll likely never hear it panning.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-e1-ease-of-use"><span>Aqara Camera E1: Ease of use</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="LwAxX4oDxCKMwC5oCg9PtH" name="Aqara-Home-app-camera-E1.jpg" alt="Aqara 2K Indoor Security Camera E1" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/LwAxX4oDxCKMwC5oCg9PtH.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Setting up the Camera E1 is simple, as the Aqara and Apple Home apps do so with a QR code. If you have everything necessary, you’ll be up and running in just a few minutes. In this case, having everything necessary would mean you own a power adapter because the E1 doesn’t come with the brick in the box, just the USB-C cable.</p><p>Setting up the privacy features in the Aqara Home app is a breeze, and though there is a bit of a delay, the manual pan and tilt features work well. You should know that once you bind the camera to HomeKit, or if you choose to forgo Aqara Home and only use HK, you lose access to many privacy features, as well as manual pan and tilt control. It will still track humans and detect motion, but you won’t be able to set those privacy positions and you lose the ability to set up to three occlusion zones. For the privacy features, you’ll have to set those up in Aqara Home as scenes first, which are then exposed to Apple Home. Then, you can trigger them using automation in Apple Home without needing the Aqara Home app.</p><p>One significant aspect of the privacy features is that they’re processed locally. The E1 has a built-in neural processing unit that enables person and sound detection on the device.</p><p>As I alluded to earlier in the piece, my only gripe with Aqara’s Indoor Security Camera E1 is that the human-tracking automatic pan and tilt is finicky. I’ve found that placement affects its ability to track, just like the Camera Hub G3. When the camera is placed around hip height (I’m 6’ tall), I’ve found it a bit slow to pan with moving objects, namely me. Place the camera higher where its AI can pick up faces, and your human tracking improves.</p>

<p>Pan and tilt options that support HomeKit Secure Video are few, but there are two other cameras worth checking out. We reviewed and liked Eufy’s Pan 2K which is now the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Assistant-Compatibility-Tracking/dp/B0856W45VL/">2K Indoor Cam E220</a> and right now its price can’t be beat at only $35.99 on Eufy’s site and Amazon. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/every-security-camera-homekit-secure-video-support">VOCOlinc Opto HomeKit Indoor Camera</a> is also an option at a lower cost, available on their site for $49.99. It also has pan and tilt functionality but is only running 1080P video which is fine because of the HKSV limitations when binding 2K cameras like the E1. HomeKit knocks 2K video down to 1080P in Apple Home and for video recorded to the cloud.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-e1-should-you-buy-it"><span>Aqara Camera E1: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li> You want pan and tilt at a great price </li><li> The privacy features are essential for your use case </li><li> You don’t need all of the Camera Hub G3 features </li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li><strong> You need to mount it on a vertical surface like a wall </strong></li></ul>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-e1-verdict"><span>Aqara Camera E1: Verdict</span></h3>
<p>With the Aqara Indoor Security Camera E1, you get quite a bit of camera for a great price. Onboard person and sound detection and robust privacy features make this a great option for use cases where what’s on camera at certain times is a concern. Wi-Fi 6 means you have more reliable live video feed access in homes with dozens of other Wi-Fi gadgets, and 360-degree rotation means you can see almost everything. </p><p>There aren’t many pan and tilts at this price point with this feature set, so the Camera E1 should be on your shortlist if you’re after PT functionality. Even if you don’t need the hub but PT is essential, consider looking at the Camera Hub G3, which has more reliable tracking, built-in facial recognition, and an alarm exposed in HomeKit.</p>

It’s beautiful on the outside, feature-packed on the inside, and has some EQ presets that liven up the party when you want. iFi Audio makes great audio kit, but they’ve outdone themselves with this one, and it will grow with you. It can be updated over the air with new Bluetooth codecs as they become available. This one’s a no-brainer—almost.</p>

<p>You can pick up the iFi GO blu for $200 direct from ifi-audio.com, or Amazon. I’d also consider picking up the $29 GO blue case with a clip from ifi-audio.com. The case makes it easier to use with your headphones by clipping them to your shirt so the microphone is closer to your mouth when you take calls.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/qudelix-5k-dac-review">Next to the Qudelix-5K</a>, this is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-dacs-iphone-and-ipad">one of the smallest DAC/Amps on the market</a> to pack this level of sophistication and features. It’s the size of a 9V battery. The unit’s exterior is wrapped in a soft-touch polymer with copper-colored trim. On the right side of the GO Blu is where you’ll find a luxurious infinitely scrolling ChronoDial, which gives you fine analog volume control and handles playback and phone functions with various clicks. Below that is the button that controls EQ preset modes, Bluetooth pairing, voice alert functions, digital filter mode, and factory reset.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="SzV5LhJCc9jSTdcBVxJ5uY" name="ifi-go-blu-audio-ports.jpg" alt="iFi GO blu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SzV5LhJCc9jSTdcBVxJ5uY.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>On the top, you’ll find an LED that tells you which EQ preset you’re using, Bluetooth connection, and digital filter status. Next to that are the balanced 4.4mm and S-Balanced 3.5mm headphone outputs. On the bottom, there’s an LED for battery status, a microphone, a factory reset pinhole, and USB input, which supports charging and audio playback up to 24bit/96kHz.</p><p>The power button is on the left side. Press it twice to hear which Bluetooth format you’re currently receiving. You’ll also use this button in conjunction with the button under the dial to turn on/off voice announcements.</p><p>This powerful device is incredibly small and light but has a delightful in-hand feel thanks to the soft-touch plastic. The buttons all give satisfying clicks, and the USB-C port has no play as you plug in and pull cables out. A refined touch is the labels on the rear etched next to all of the buttons, telling you what they do so you don’t have to remember all the things. They do a lot!</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="esZfgHiwx7S2eH5tCnnQyZ" name="ifi-go-blu-solo.jpg" alt="iFi GO blu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/esZfgHiwx7S2eH5tCnnQyZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>We touched on hardware features as we talked about build quality and fit, so let’s discuss what some of those features do in a bit more detail. The GO Blu comes with three presets: XBass, XSpace, and XBass + XSpace. The first two boost bass and expand the soundstage, respectively. The third is a combo of both. As a bass lover, I’d like to have more control over how much the bass is boosted, but for most, it will give an appreciable bump that doesn’t overpower the rest of the mix</p><p>The 3.5mm output features balanced circuits instead of the single-ended circuit approach traditionally used in most products around this price point. This reduces noise, giving you clearer sound.</p><p>The GO Blu uses Qualcomm’s QCC5100 chip, in conjunction with the Cirrus Logic 43131, supporting aptX Adaptive/HD/LL, LDAC, LHDC, AAC, and SBC with the ability to be updated over the air to add newer codecs. Because the GO blu is calling enabled and uses that QCC chip, you also get active noise canceling with those mics so that you can use traditional IEMs or headphones during your commute or in the office and have the ability to take and make calls with minimal interruption to your listening flow. Pick up the GO blu case with a clip so you can clip it to your shirt and make hands-free calling even easier.</p><p>I haven’t worn the battery down yet, but it gets me through an entire workday and is rated for ten hours. A high-powered charger (6.3v) can recharge the GO blu in 40 minutes.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-go-blu-sound-quality"><span>iFi GO blu: Sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="qkYe48LWkVAhNbwzQ6pjjc" name="ifi-go-blu-bluetooth.jpg" alt="iFi GO blu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/qkYe48LWkVAhNbwzQ6pjjc.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>So, with all of this technology packed in such a small space, how does it sound? I’ve listened through both the 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports, utilizing both Bluetooth and wired USB-C audio sources, and I’ll tell you that the output from this DAC/Amp is an elevated experience. I tested audio quality with sensitive and hard-to-drive IEMs from 1MORE, Campfire Audio, and Sennheiser’s IE900. For headphones, I did the same, using Sennheiser and HiFiMan planar magnetic over-ear headphones.</p><p>Knowing that the iPhone only supports AAC, I wanted to hear what the GO blu could do with one of the Hi-Res codecs. In this case, LDAC connected to a Pixel 7 Pro, and both codecs were a delight. The LDAC stream offers more dynamics, but iPhone owners won’t feel left out, as the sonic imaging is still quite nice via AAC.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="Gmb2qZyYg4RyKm6YfECzYd" name="ifi-go-blu-iems.jpg" alt="iFi GO blu" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Gmb2qZyYg4RyKm6YfECzYd.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The wired connection, giving you access to Apple Music lossless audio, is transcendent. Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes,” and the main title track from the “Get Out” film’s soundtrack, Michael Abels’ haunting “Sikiliza Kwa Wahenga” were both ethereal experiences for their large, open soundstage. With the right pairing, the imaging with the iFi GO blu is highly analytical, allowing you to lose yourself in the nuances of the music you’re listening to. Paired to headphones or IEMs which aren’t very analytical themselves, you still get impressive clarity and nuance.</p><p>The overall sound signature is very balanced and neutral, which is why I’m thankful for the XBass feature. Getting that bump in the low end made hip-hop tracks that much more enjoyable when I connected the 4.4mm cables of Sennheiser’s IE900, which itself has a very neutral sound. The Go blu really gives you bright, sparkly upper mid, and high-frequency reproduction without being sibilant or harsh. The entire listening experience is smooth without compromising instrument attack or nuance, and I never had to crank my phone’s volume past 75%. Most of the time, I listened at highly satisfying levels with the slider up to around 50%.</p>

<p>Interestingly, iFi’s own Zen DAC 3 is at the same price point, but that DAC is larger and more tailored toward a desktop experience with its available 5V Dc input. Then, you’ll want to look at the FiiO BTR7. It has similar features, but no mics for calling, and a bit less battery life. It does, however have a companion app with parametric EQ, which the GO blu doesn’t. </p><p>Quedelix 5k is $100 cheaper and while it doesn’t quite have as expansive a soundstage, it is definitely a very capable Bluetooth/USB-C DAC/Amp and has microphones for calling. Add to that it’s insanely impressive companion app with robust parametric EQ settings and it becomes a very tempting competitor. I’ve purchased the Quedelix 5k for my personal use, but I will be buying the GO blu at some point as well.</p>

It’s all very kawaii (Japanese slang for “cute”) if you’re into anime and such, but that cute little face belies a monster of a device inside. </p><p>It does <em>a lot</em> and you’re going to wind up asking yourself, “Do I run this through HomeKit or their proprietary app Aqara Home, or a bit of both?” It may be overwhelming. Good thing the Apple Home and Aqara Home apps are both well-designed and easy to use. Let’s get into it!</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g3-price-and-availability"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G3: Price and availability</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="JoAHWUPysPdKnLtZ7gzGnP" name="Aqara-camera-hub-G3-living-room.jpg" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/JoAHWUPysPdKnLtZ7gzGnP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Aqara 2K Security Indoor Camera Hub G3 is available through Amazon for $109.99 but looking over price tracking history, in December and January, the G3 was on sale in the 80-dollar range.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g3-specs-and-features"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G3: Specs and features</span></h3>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="GtFe8csn3ifoYcznoLgcpN" name="Aqara-camera-hub-G3-lens-closeup.jpg" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G3" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/GtFe8csn3ifoYcznoLgcpN.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Camera Hub G3 is a nearly five-inch tall robot-shaped device that pans 340 degrees horizontally, tilts 30 degrees up, and 15 degrees down. It can do that automatically with AI-powered tracking, or manually via the Aqara app, but no manual control in Apple’s Home app. Pair that all with a 110-degree field of view; you should be able to capture everything in almost any room. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="dcEaWppyH3B7TozKEvaY2k" name="Aqara-camera-hub-G3-DAY.JPG" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G3 Video Samples" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/dcEaWppyH3B7TozKEvaY2k.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="1" width="2304" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class="expandable"></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>

<p>The centerpiece of the unit, the high-resolution 2K 2304x1296P camera, and its infrared night vision LED module have a face on it, which is cute and functional. When the G3 is “live” you can see the camera, but for privacy, you can stop the live feed and the lens module rotates into the “head” housing, exposing another look, eyelashes. Yes, you can tell the camera is “sleeping” because the face shows that. </p><p>If you’re still uncomfortable with that, you can store a preset viewing angle and send it there. To the left and right of the lens and LEDs are two microphones that allow you to have two-way conversations, detect abnormal sounds, stream audio, and record it. The audio recording is pretty good from the dual mic setup! </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jj7RUy7GBaDJMypZUKUQBP" name="Aqara-camera-hub-G3-microSD.jpg" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G3, microSD slot exposed" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jj7RUy7GBaDJMypZUKUQBP.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The front also has a microSD slot which supports up to 128GB of storage. You access it by turning off the camera’s live feed and having the cute eyelash cover rotate into view. Below is a status LED that glows red when active, along with some subtle branding. The back of the camera is where you’ll find the speaker and the USB-C port which also supports video output directly from the unit via the UVC protocol, so if you connect the Camera Hub G3 to your computer for example, it should automatically recognize it.</p><p>You can set the Camera Hub G3 on a flat surface like a bookshelf, or mount it via the standard tripod quarter-inch threads on the bottom. It can be mounted upside down, then the image adjusted accordingly in the Aqara Home app.</p><p>Aqara’s Camera Hub G3 has a neural processing unit (NPU), powering some AI functions that don’t require an internet connection. A Zigbee 3.0 smart home hub on board allows you to connect up to 128 Aqara devices to the G3, though you’ll need to include repeater devices like a wall switch or smart plug in your setup to achieve that number.</p><p>The Camera Hub G3 supports both 2.4 and 5GHz Wi-Fi connections, and Wi-Fi Protected Access 3 (WPA3). There’s also IR blaster support for your home devices which still use that standard.</p>

<p>The Aqara Camera Hub G3 looks like something you’d buy in a Sanrio store (Hello Kitty) until you remove the pre-installed cat ears accessory hood. You can set the Camera Hub G3 on a flat surface like a bookshelf, or mount it via the standard tripod quarter-inch threads on the bottom. It can be mounted upside down, then the image adjusted accordingly in the Aqara Home app.</p><p>Though it’s mostly plastic, the Camera Hub G3 gives the impression that it is well-made and will be long-lasting indoors. The pan and tilt motor is whisper quiet, and the different faces for the lens cover, though novel, put the “fun” in “functional.” It should look right at home with just about any decor, and you can remove those cat ears if that’s a bit too flamboyant for your feng shui.</p>

<p>Aqara’s Camera Hub G3 does so much that it would take a few pages of a deep, deep dive article to address them all thoroughly, yet its features in the Aqara app are clearly laid out and easy to use. And since not all of those features are exposed in Apple Home, it’s even easier to use there. That was one of the hallmarks of all the Aqara cameras I’ve tested recently, ease of use. This G3 was set up in less than ten minutes and I thoroughly enjoyed the voice confirmations I received from the unit as I completed specific steps in the onboarding process.</p><p>I have the G3 connected to my 5GHz wifi network. Opening either app and connecting to its live feeds has been fast each time. I’ve even opened Apple Home on my Apple Watch Series 9 and held conversations with my wife, which was pretty cool! No glitching, fluid audio, and picture, all from my wrist.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:2304px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="4Ygy8CC3VhE7ixS6do4NXi" name="Aqara-Camera-Camera-Hub-G3-DAY2.JPG" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G3 Video Samples" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/4Ygy8CC3VhE7ixS6do4NXi.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="2304" height="1296" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Movement tracking is easy with the G3. You can set it to track humans, dogs, and cats, work with face detection, or gestures, and there’s a cruise option that will set the camera to pan and tilt to pre-defined positions for a period of time. Face detection from Aqara works by uploading pics from your phone, or snapping a pic of someone’s face right then and there. Then you can set automations like getting a notification when little Jamaal gets home from school. Gesture activation allows you to assign automations to five different hand gestures, but that disables the human and animal tracking functions.</p><p>Speaking of tracking, I really thought the G3’s ability to keep up with the humans it was tracking was admirable. If someone is running, or moving rapidly, it may lose them though. When the G3 is tracking someone and panning and tilting to keep up, you’ll see the video pixelate a bit until the camera settles, and then the video clears up and is solid again.</p><p>For the security conscious, using the Aqara Home app’s face detection requires you to upload those images to Aqara’s cloud servers. With the G3 having a built-in neural processing unit, I’d like to see facial recognition store images locally as well. </p><p>There are some other minor issues I’d like to see improved. The graininess the camera picks up when it’s in motion isn’t ideal. I’d also like to see the manual pan and tilt features, as well as the predefined position setting available in Apple’s Home app.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g3-competition"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G3: Competition</span></h3>
<p>There isn’t a lot of competition at this price point with comparable features, considering the G3 has a built-in Zigbee hub. </p><p>One alternative worth a look at is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/eufy-Security-Assistant-Compatibility-Tracking/dp/B0856W45VL/">Eufy’s E220</a>. It has a larger 125-degree field of view and an 8X digital zoom. The E220 is half the price but is 2.4GHz wifi only, has no privacy mode, and doesn’t include a built-in hub for connecting other IoT devices. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g3-should-you-buy-it"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G3: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy it if..</strong></p>
<ul><li>You like Aqara and want to connect more devices</li><li>You want a pan and tilt HKSV camera with a robust feature-set</li><li>You want a camera with a physical privacy mode</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy it if…</strong></p>
<p><ul>
  <li>You want a camera closer to $50</li>
  <li>You don’t need hub functionality</li>
</ul></p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g3-verdict"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G3: Verdict</span></h3>
<p>Besides being a cute camera with removable cat ears, Aqara’s Camera Hub G3 is a powerhouse of features at a fair price. Aqara has some great IoT devices in their offerings of motion sensors, window/door sensors, and automated blinds, so having the hub built-in is a great feature. </p><p>With Matter support, HomeKit exposed alarm functionality, USB-C video out, local storage, and local AI processing, you have a winning package that is hard to beat in the indoor pan and tilt camera market. The Aqara Camera Hub G3 is easy to recommend.</p>

<p>The iFi Zen DAC 3 is currently available direct from ifi-audio.com or Amazon for $229. It hasn’t gone on sale since it’s been on Amazon, so if you’re in the market and looking at this, there is no better time to buy it.</p><p>For what you’re getting, the price is pretty solid as competing devices don’t have the same number of features at this price. Want more, you’ll have to pay more, generally speaking.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-zen-dac-3-build-and-fit"><span>iFi Zen DAC 3: Build and fit</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="hoQw6NFQmzzNU4WQEjDFK9" name="ifi-zen-dac-3-solo.jpg" alt="iFi Zen DAC 3 desktop DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/hoQw6NFQmzzNU4WQEjDFK9.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Constructed of aluminum, the Zen DAC 3 has a solid heft when you pick it up. All of the buttons give reassuring clicky feedback, the volume knob is smooth and beautifully machined, and the ports are tight and feel well manufactured. There are a lot of little details to appreciate on the Zen DAC 3, from the various textures of the brushed or dimpled metal surfaces to the Sunlit Bronze accents, buttons, and knobs to the dust covers on the RCA inputs on the back of the device.</p><p>A lot of design elements were well considered and it shows.</p><p>There are rubber feet on the bottom of the device, another nice detail that will save the finish on the bottom. It’s smart because those feet provide extra grip on the bottom as you plug/unplug cables. Additionally, the unit is so light that those rubber feet will keep the DAC from moving around on your desk due to cable movement if you’re fidgety while listening to your tunes.</p><p>Lastly, when we talk “build,” the input/outputs are intuitively placed. There is I/O on the back of the Zen DAC 3, but it makes sense to have outputs there because they connect to larger external devices than a pair of headphones.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-zen-dac-3-features"><span>iFi Zen DAC 3: Features</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="vqPzX3uxFNQRP4NmhswXMB" name="ifi-zen-dac-3-volume-knob-led.jpg" alt="iFi Zen DAC 3 desktop DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vqPzX3uxFNQRP4NmhswXMB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Zen DAC 3 has two headphone jacks in the front. One balanced 4.4mm input pushing 390mW at 64ohms, and one 6.3mm input pushing 210mW@32ohms. Inside the box, you’ll get a 3.5mm to 6.3mm adapter since there’s no input for one of the most common types of audio interfaces. Also on the front are the Power Match and XBass Plus buttons. Power Match provides a gain boost for power-hungry headphones, while XBass is iFi’s signature analog bass enhancer.</p><p>That beautiful analog volume nob on the front also doubles as an audio format LED that glows in seven different colors indicating the audio format and sampling frequency being received from the audio source.</p><p>The rear of the unit is where you’ll find the USB-C input with overvoltage protection, a DC 5V input, another balanced 4.4mm out (2V-6.2V max variable, 4.2 fixed), and RCA outputs (1V-3.3V max variable, 2.1V fixed). The output impedance on those is 200ohm and 100ohms, respectively. The 4.4mm and RCA outputs allow you to connect this DAC/Amp as a preamp to another amp or active speakers. Since you have these I/O options, it was also smart for iFi to add a fixed or variable output gain switch to the back of the unit.</p><p>All of these outputs and their features are powered by a bit-perfect DSD and DXD Burr Brown DAC, which supports PCM up to 768kHz, DSD up to DSD 512, and full MQA decoding.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-zen-dac-3-sound-quality"><span>iFi Zen DAC 3: Sound quality</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="jYkj5nDuvcaNsY8STHNd28" name="ifi-zen-dac-3-rear-io.jpg" alt="iFi Zen DAC 3 desktop DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/jYkj5nDuvcaNsY8STHNd28.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sound quality places the iFi GO blu and GO bar Kensei among my favorite DACs, both of which use Cirrus Logic chipsets, but the Zen DAC 3 utilizes a Burr Brown DAC whose sound quality differs from the former two. The word that best describes the Burr Brown chip is “smooth.” Its tuning isn’t as “transparent” as the Kensei, but it makes the listening experience with the Zen DAC 3 fun and engaging.</p><p>One of my regular test tracks, “Moanin’,” has some horn sections that can be quite harsh, but the Zen DAC 3 makes those sections easy to listen to as its smooth top end mitigates the shrill blasts from the brass. </p><p>If you want a break from the smoother curve in your lower frequencies, the XBass Plus analog mode restores the growl back to bass and sub-bass. But this isn’t some muddy, compressed digital filter. The low end boost is tight and controlled. Activating this makes listening to bass-heavy tracks quite enjoyable, especially if you’re using flatter headphones like a pair of Planar Magnetics. Without XBass Plus active, and using more balanced or flat headphones or IEMs, tracks like Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power,” with its deep bass and sub-bass, lose a bit of their bite. </p><p>Despite being smooth, you still get great stereo imaging, with a wonderful feel for the instruments and where they’re layered in the sonic image. And those images will always feel nice and full thanks to the Power Match feature, which boosts gain and provided enough output for my Sennheiser HD660S2 and HiFiMan HE-4XX that, depending on the track, I never needed to push that analog volume higher than 50% to 75% of its max. For my IEMs, with Power Match off, I only need to turn the volume nob to 25% of its max output for nice, full audio.</p><p>The Zen DAC 3 is an all-around great DAC to connect to your laptop or desktop for warm, smooth sound that doesn’t compromise mid-range vocals or allow harsher sounds in the higher frequencies to become grating. I’d definitely categorize this as “fun and entertaining” as far as DACs and active listening go. It&apos;s great for listening to music at a desk or watching movies.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-ifi-zen-dac-3-competition"><span>iFi Zen DAC 3: Competition</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1080px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:100.00%;"><img id="SK6itwyrzzJ8GVEQ2cmGJ8" name="fiio-k7-square.jpeg" alt="Fiio Audio K7 desktop DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/SK6itwyrzzJ8GVEQ2cmGJ8.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1080" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Fiio Audio)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a few alternatives to the Zen DAC 3, but there are trade-offs. Many use different USB standards, making mobile phone connectivity a pain. For example, the Fiio K7 and Topping DX3 Pro Plus are both great options but utilize USB-B connections. On the upside, you’ll get coax and optical connectivity. The DX3 Pro Plus even has a built-in screen.</p><p>Then there’s the Schiit Magni, which does offer a USB-C connection. Look at the internal DAC option, which will run you $189 and give you many of the features of the Zen DAC 3. The downside to this one is the headphone cable connectivity options. On the front, you get only one ¼”, aka 6.35mm, single-ended jack. No balanced 3.5mm is available, so you’ll have to use an adapter. It is worth checking out.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Zen DAC 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want a capable laptop/mobile phone/desktop DAC</li><li>You want a DAC that can power headphones or active speakers</li><li>You want quality without breaking the bank</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Zen DAC 3 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want Bluetooth connectivity</li><li>You want coaxial/optical audio connectivity</li></ul>
<p>For a semi-mobile DAC that produces smooth sound and has some great connectivity options, the Zen DAC 3 is well worth its price tag! You get a beautiful piece of hardware, a smart feature set, and plenty of power to drive just about any pair of headphones or IEMs you plug into it. XBass Plus makes the DAC something that even bass heads can get into!</p><p>The beauty of the Zen line is that iFi just released a couple of new versions, which, between the three, should cover the needs of just about anyone looking for a semi-mobile desktop DAC. </p>

<p>You can buy the Fosi Audio DS2 2024 directly from Fosiaudio.com or Amazon for $59.99. At that price point, you won’t find many portable DACs/Amps with both a 3.5mm and 4.4mm port. The nearest competition is around $80.</p>

<p>Coming in at 3.2 ounces, the DS2 2024 feels effortlessly light. But don’t let that fool ya, oh no! It’s CNC machined from solid metal, and Fosi claims it’s shock-resistant. I’m guessing they’re pretty confident because unlike most of the DACs I’ve tested recently, this one comes with a two-year warranty, as opposed to one year.</p><p>Externally, you’ll get a sample rate LED indicator on one side. The 3.5mm and 4.4mm ports are on the bottom, and opposite those on the top is the USB-C port. Left side, you get independent 60-step volume controls, which give a satisfyingly clicky feedback when pressed.</p><p>Internally dual Cirrus Log CS43131 DAC chips are powering those 3.5mm and 4.4mm outputs.</p>

<p>The DS2 2024 isn’t a powerhouse of features, but most of what it does, it does well. It supports up to DSD256 and PCM 32-BIT/385kHz decoding, pushing 510mw at 32ohms out of the 4.4mm, and a somewhat anemic 130mw at 32ohms out of the 3.5mm connection.</p><p>The top face of the DS2 2024 has an LED next to the Fosi Audio branding that tells you what you’re decoding. For PCM, anything less than 48kHz = Red, 48-96kHz = Green, 96-384kHz = Yellow. For DSD, all sample rates get the blue light.</p>

<p>My only quibble is that the 3.5mm port is a bit underpowered. My Campfire Audio Mammoths had to be cranked up higher than with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-dacs-iphone-and-ipad">any other DAC I’ve used to date</a>. Usually, I have to keep my volume slider around 10% of max to avoid damaging my hearing with the Mammoths, which are quite sensitive. With the DS2 2024, I really pushed the volume, and that doesn’t bode well for power-hungry IEMs.</p>

<p>This $60 DAC/Amp has impressive sound for its price point! I’d characterize the DS2 2024 as a warm DAC/Amp that doesn’t sacrifice clarity or detail for that bump in the lows and mids.</p><p>I listened to several different playlists through Sennheiser’s HD660S2s and their sublime IE900 IEMs. I also connected Campfire Audio’s Mammoth IEMs and HiFiMan HE-4XX planar magnetic headphones. Charles Mingus’ “Moanin’” is an intricately detailed and mixed big band jazz romp that shines a light on the DS2&apos;s detail and musicality. It reproduces that track with almost analytic precision, allowing you to bask in the separation of the instruments and how they’re layered in the stereo image.</p><p>The bass and mids aren’t earth-shattering, but they are entertaining. On that same Mingus track, the upright bass is present and assertive without stepping on the horns or hi-hat. Skrillex’s “Mumbai Power” and Big K.R.I.T.’s “My Sub” growl and rumble with aplomb.</p><p>In listening to Paul Simon’s “Diamonds on the Souls of Her Shoes” and the Get Out OST track “Shikilinga Kwa XXXX,” you’ll discover the closed-back headphone-like soundstage. To be clear, the vocals are bright. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/beats-solo-4-playing-a-tune-made-for-apple-lossless">On good headphones</a> and with DACs that don’t smooth out the mids and highs, Paul Simon’s vocals are just a hair shy of sibilant, as was the case with the DS2. The shrill horns I regularly reference in Art Blakey’s “Moanin’” are expectedly shrill with the DS2.</p><p>Overall, this is a great listening experience for $60, and it will grow with you thanks to its inclusion of the 4.4mm balanced connection that should have sufficient power to drive all but the most extremely demanding headphones and IEMs.</p>

<p>The competition at $60 is almost non-existent. There is competition in hardware from the HiBy FC4, Fiio KA13, and Fiio Ka3. All three share similar features and have both single-ended and balanced outputs, but you’re going to pay $20 more for them with no significant difference in sound quality.</p><p>Then there’s the iFi GO link, which will run you the same $60 but won’t get you the same features. You’ll get the 3.5mm single-ended port but no 4.4mm, or 2.5mm balanced output and no on-device volume controls.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Fosi Audio DS2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You’re on a budget</li><li>You have good headphones/IEMs with 4.4mm cables</li><li>You’re just getting into Apple Lossless</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Fosi Audio DS2 if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You have power hungry 3.5mm cabled IEMs</li></ul>
<p>At this price point, you won’t find many options with a 3.5mm and 4.4mm balanced audio jack. For $59.99, the clarity and detail of the Fosi Audio DS2 2024 make this an excellent choice for those just diving into audiophile territory. It even provides enough bass and sub-bass to satisfy the bass heads among us. </p><p>With a solid build quality and a 24-month warranty, the DS2 is a solid investment in enjoying hi-resolution audio.</p>

<p>The Quedelix-5K is available direct from Quedelix for $109, or from Amazon for $110. You likely won’t find it on sale but for everything you get with the Quedelix-5K, and when compared to its competition, $110 is a fair price point. </p><p>Some folks may have an issue with the plastic body at this price, but it doesn&apos;t feel cheap, and there’s a reason for that build decision. We’ll get into that in a moment.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-qudelix-5k-build-and-fit"><span>Qudelix-5K: Build and fit</span></h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="PQ3Xgd8fBX2ShR3qFpUFeZ" name="qudelix-5k-red-button.jpg" alt="Qudelix 5k Bluetooth DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/PQ3Xgd8fBX2ShR3qFpUFeZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Qudelix-5K feels very light in hand, although it is heavy in hardware and software features. It has a plastic body, which ensures you get a solid Bluetooth connection to your music source. Metal bodies tend to attenuate radio frequency signals. Look at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-homekit-router">build of your home router</a>, for example. Metal or plastic? Internally, you get a lot for $110. The 5k is packed with a Qualcomm BT 5.0 chipset and dual ES9219 SABRE HiFi DAC, which supports single-ended and balanced outputs and high-sensitivity MEMs mics for phone calls. </p><p>Externally, you’ll find the lone microphone port on the top of the unit next to the 3.5mm and 2.5mm ports. There’s a handy spring-loaded aluminum clip on the underside of the unit and two confusing buttons on the sides. Neither is labeled, and that’s the only pain point I have with the external setup. One button is the volume rocker, and on the other side of the unit, you have the power button, which also controls Bluetooth functions: pairing, playback, track skipping, and phone calls. Once powered on, the buttons glow red and blue when pressed, making them easier to use. The blue-lit button controls the Bluetooth functions.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="iD5k3674MHvJS7hL8yfLBZ" name="qudelix-5k-blue-button.jpg" alt="Qudelix 5k Bluetooth DAC/Amp" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/iD5k3674MHvJS7hL8yfLBZ.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Besides the button labeling, my only other issue is the choice of a 2.5mm port instead of a 4.4mm port. I’m sure this decision was based on unit size but I’d take a larger 5k for the 4.4mm port. Reading online forums, a common complaint is that quite a few people have snapped those tiny 2.5mm pins. Your mileage may vary.</p>
<h2 class="article-body__section" id="section-qudelix-5k-features"><span>Qudelix-5K: Features</span></h2>

<p>The Qudelix-5K offers great codec support for Bluetooth streaming, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/do-you-really-need-an-external-dac-to-get-the-most-from-apple-music">which iPhones won’t be able to take advantage of</a>. In addition to the standard SBC and AAC, you also get support for aptX Adaptive, LDAC, and aptX HD. This is an important note because app support for the device extends to your computers through a Chrome browser plug-in. Even with iOS’ lack of Hi-Res Bluetooth codec support, you should still download the app because iOS and iPad OS don’t have EQ support that works across all your apps. Quedelix app’s settings, though, are ubiquitous and saved directly to the 5k’s internal storage. This is to say, once you have it configured to your liking, that sound profile will be persistent across every device you connect to it: car, phone, tablet, computer, etc. That also means it is persistent no matter which music apps you use on your mobile devices.</p>

<p>The app&apos;s most important feature is the 20-band PEQ, which can also be set to a 10-band left/right independent PEQ. This is where the 5k shines. As you dive into the world of “coloring” your audio to your liking, this is a great way to hear how fine changes in the EQ curve affect your audio in real time. This is a welcomed feature for audiophiles and a brilliant teaching tool for audiophile neophytes. Best of all, you can save up to 20 of your EQ settings, and there’s an exhaustive database of automatic EQ presets that you can access in the DSP tab of the app.</p><p>Sure, other manufacturers offer EQ support, but often, it isn’t true PEQ. You generally get EQ presets or simple 3 or 5-band EQ support with no option for things like pre-gain, headroom, peak filters, high or low-shelf filters, and Q factor (frequency bandwidth) adjustment.</p><p>The app will also show you the state and stats for your current input (BT or USB-C), show you important battery/power consumption stats, give you control over gain, and both coarse and fine control over volume with separate sliders for the phone’s volume and the 5k’s. Note that you can also control volume directly from the 5k itself.</p>

<p>On its own, the Qudelix-5K reproduces audio beautifully. It doesn’t have as large a soundstage or that sparkle that <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/ifi-go-blu-review">my current fave iFi GO blu</a> has, but that one doesn’t have the PEQ. But, again, that is the 5k’s strength. I hooked Sennheiser’s $1500 IEMs, the IE900, up to the Quedelix 5k, and the first listen through the 3.5mm cable was wonderful. The sound is well-balanced and nuanced, a delight. </p><p>Next, I connected the 2.5mm cable to get the balanced output power, turned on the PEQ, and added some bottom to the sub-bass and bass in the 31 and 63Hz frequencies and Sweet Christmas, I grinned ear-to-ear like the Cheshire cat when I played “Start a Riot” from the Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse soundtrack! It’s a delicious Dolby Atmos mix that shows what can be achieved when a producer knows how to use those tools effectively. The IE900s aren’t a bass head’s IEM at all. With the 5k’s PEQ, they become just that, but the mid and high-end clarity is not diminished. The bass on that track becomes downright dark and nasty and makes me want to get in the ring and bang leather with one of my Muay Thai buddies. </p><p>The right PEQ settings can take enjoyable music and make it transcendent. They can take you from having a listening session to having a listening experience. With the right headphones or IEMs, of course.</p><p>This is a last note on the Qudelix-5K. I threw a few headphones and sensitive, low, and high-impedance IEMs at it, and it drove everything with aplomb.</p>

<p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-dacs-iphone-and-ipad">There are a few other options</a> at $100, but none of them offer true PEQ like the Qudelix-5K. For example, options from FiiO will give you EQ customization through their app, but the level and variety of customizations are greater with the 5k. </p><p>The closest device is FiiO’s BTR15, which has MQA support and native DSD support for the same $110. It also includes an OLED display, which the 5K doesn’t have and it uses 4.4mm instead of 2.5mm balanced output. Shanling has their UP4 2022, which is larger, has a larger battery, and includes codec support for LHDC. They all feature single-ended and balanced outputs, but the app makes all the difference, so I’d choose the Quedelix 5k over its competition.</p>

<p><strong>You should buy the Qudelix-5K Bluetooth DAC/Amp if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You’re interested in fine-tuning audio</li><li>Cost is a primary factor in your DAC purchase</li><li>You want a DAC for almost any source</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn&apos;t buy the Qudelix-5K Bluetooth DAC/Amp if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You don’t need Bluetooth connectivity</li><li>You prefer 4.4mm outputs</li></ul>
<p>The Quedelix-5K is well worth the cost for the parametric EQ alone! When you consider all of the unit’s other features, I think this device is a no-brainer for those who want to learn about crafting their ideal sound curve or those who already know how to but want a device they can take anywhere and connect to almost any audio source. You can even use the 5K as a preamp.</p><p>If true PEQ piques your interest, look no further. This is the one.</p>

Window/door, temperature, motion, and vibration sensors are among the items you can buy from them but when you put a device like the Camera Hub G2H Pro in the mix, you can now connect everything without needing a separate hub. That and some strong privacy and security features make this an indoor security camera well worth taking a hard look at. </p>

<p>What I like about Aqara and this camera hub is their attention to privacy features and ease of use. Going into the Aqara Home app, you can tap into the video settings and set up a privacy occlusion area. Let’s say you’re in a condominium and your children&apos;s bedroom windows are on the first floor. You want to place a camera but don’t want them recorded, only the window. Tap into the privacy occlusion area feature, and using a grid, you can drag up to three areas on the screen which will place black bars over your recordings.

<p>For a 1080P camera, the video is pretty good. There is better out there, but ultimately HomeKit Secure Video takes all those 2k and 4k cameras and records in 1080P anyway. Mounted opposite a large sliding glass door, the light streaming in from it washes out some details on that side of the room, but you’re going to deal with that from many cameras to varying degrees. Details in videos like lettering on a picture on the wall, and faces are easy to make out within around 20 feet from the camera, but the further out you go, they’ll lose fine detail.</p><p>Supporting Siri, Alexa, and Google Home makes this a great camera for someone like me who uses iOS primarily, but whose wife prefers Google and Alexa. Using Ark 2.0  makes this a unique option for failsafe automation usage. </p><p>In a nutshell, Ark 2.0 allows some of your devices to connect to others via a mesh network and still run local automation even if the internet connection goes down. This is a critical security function because there are those with nefarious intentions who use Wi-Fi jammers to knock out internet-connected cameras before breaking into a home. And those jammers are fairly easy to come by for those interested in committing property crimes. </p><p>In terms of connectivity, the G2H is 2.4GHz Wi-Fi only, with a built-in Zigbee 3.0 hub. It is powered by a dated microUSB to USB-A cable.</p>

<p>The Camera Hub G2H Pro is a plastic affair, but I haven&apos;t seen a bunch of negative reviews or Reddit posts complaining about long-term durability. It&apos;s smaller than Aqara&apos;s G3, and E1, standing a diminutive 3.24 inches tall by 2 inches wide, unless you raise it up on its extendable base. </p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1920px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="8zBKrozpms9aCGyGUVwSTB" name="Aqara-camera-hub-G2H-pro-kitchen.jpg" alt="Aqara Camera Hub G2H Pro" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/8zBKrozpms9aCGyGUVwSTB.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1920" height="1080" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Tshaka Armstrong)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The bottom of the G2H Pro features a magnet that is strong enough to attach to many metallic or iron surfaces. I mounted mine to an iron apron hook thingy in my kitchen/dining room area, and it feels quite solid there. Also, on the bottom, you&apos;ll find a microSD slot that supports up to 512GB of storage and, next to that, a reset button.</p>

<p> Aqara’s Camera Hub G2H Pro is easy to set up and use. Opening the box, you’re met with a micro USB to USB A cable, but no power adapter, a 3M patch for mounting to various surfaces, the manual, an ejector tool, and a metal plate. I didn’t use the metal plate or the 3M sticker for mounting; instead, I used the powerful magnet to attach it to an apron hook mounted on the wall between my kitchen and dining room. Mounting there felt quite secure and gave me views of my dining area, living room, and a portion of my kitchen. </p><p>Connecting the camera to the Aqara app and HomeKit was as easy as scanning some QR codes, and following the prompts, which took less than 10 minutes to do.</p><p>Once connected to Wi-Fi, you can go through the Aqara app and configure all of the privacy and security, automation, motion/abnormal sound detection, and custom ringtone settings. Since the Hub G2H Pro now supports Apple HomeKit Security, you can jump into the Apple Home app and set up automation and alerts based on the four-alarm modes supported in that app. With those alarm modes and any motion or sound detection configured, you can use the available onboard storage, up to 512GB via microSD, to run your video continuously 24/7 or per alarm event. You’ll get about a week’s worth of video if you run it 24/7.</p>

<p>At $69.99 the Camera Hub G2H Pro doesn’t really have a direct competitor because it includes the Zigbee 3.0 hub. That said, for $40 more you should take a look at Aqara’s Camera Hub G3. </p><p>The Hub G3 also supports connection with up to 128 Aqara smart home devices, but it advances every feature the G2H Pro has except for image occlusion. The G3 also adds pan and tilt to the equation. And if a $40 difference seems steep, a quick look at historical pricing shows that the G3 has been on sale twice in the last four months for $87.49, which is only a ~$15 difference. </p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g2h-pro-should-you-buy-it"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G2H Pro: Should you buy it?</span></h3>
<p><strong>You should buy this if...</strong></p>
<ul><li>You are invested in the Aqara ecosystem</li><li>You want a camera with great mounting options</li><li>You want a camera with great privacy options</li></ul>
<p><strong>You shouldn’t buy it if…</strong></p>
<ul><li>You want pan/tilt/zoom functionality</li><li>You want 5GHz Wi-Fi connectivity</li></ul>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-aqara-camera-hub-g2h-pro-verdict"><span>Aqara Camera Hub G2H Pro: Verdict</span></h3>
<p>A built-in Zigbee 3.0 hub, flexible mounting options, great privacy controls, and good video make the Aqara Camera Hub G2H Pro a great option for those wanting to fill their home up with Aqara’s wallet-friendly sensors and camera options. And the $69.99 price point for all of that isn’t bad either. Add onto that HomeKit Security and Ark 2.0 support and you have a robust hub, camera, and basic security system to help watch over and protect what’s precious to you. </p><p>If you’re just jumping into the market, I’d suggest looking at the newer Camera Hub G3, but you may not need all that has to offer. Either way, the G2H Pro is a good purchase in building out your smart home security.  </p>

Not that Apple itself is averse to AI integrations — the latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18-rumored-features-supported-devices-and-more"><u>iOS 18</u></a> release is set to get an update that will include baked-in access to ChatGPT and OpenAI tech. </p><p>But iPhones, including the brand new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-release-date-rumors-news-and-more"><u>iPhone 16</u></a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-pro-release-date-rumors-news-and-more"><u>iPhone 16 Pro</u></a>, still make use of AI as a feature rather than a product unto itself, and that will be the differentiating factor for this new device. OpenAI will be at the core. What industrial design form that will take is “still being determined”, but Ive’s team has exemplary pedigree — some of his new crew worked alongside him on iPhone designs over the years.</p>
<h2 id="a-device-revolution-to-come-2">A device revolution to come?</h2>
<p>Ive’s project won’t be the first to try to make a bespoke, built-for-purpose AI hardware design. But early forays into the market have been mixed at best.</p><p>The Rabbit R1 released earlier this year, and charmed with its cutesy phone-like design. But its actual usefulness, swapping out traditional apps for generative AI responses, proved clunky. Likewise, the Humane AI pin launched to great hype, but soon fell flat of the limitations its wearable form factor presented.</p><p>But if anyone can create an AI device form factor that actually works, it’s Ive. His meticulous attention to detail has been hugely influential in the world of tech, revolutionizing computing device design. If his focus was ever in question, take this secondary snippet from the article: he’s just spent five years working on a book about the <em>history of buttons.</em></p>

But have you considered a projector that can deliver video as big as 200 inches? This is where the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uk.seenebula.com/products/d2342-cosmos-4k-se-projector" target="_blank">NEBULA Cosmos 4K SE Projector</a> comes in.</p><p>Priced at <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/NEBULA-Projector-High-Brightness-Brightness-HybridBeam/dp/B0DBQ7XP2H" target="_blank">$1299</a> / <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCN1FN61" target="_blank">£1299</a>, Nebula&apos;s latest product wants to redefine what it means to use a projector, which brought me back to a time when I was back in school. Back then, projectors were used to showcase Microsoft PowerPoint presentations to large classrooms, but the image would be so dark and grainy that it would be hard to decipher what the slides displayed.</p><p>Fast forward to 2024, and projectors have come a long way. Compact projectors can generate gigantic images with no degradation with very high brightness. The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://uk.seenebula.com/products/d2342-cosmos-4k-se-projector?utm_source=google&utm_medium=search&utm_content=nebula&utm_campaign=uk_nebula_brand_Mobile&utm_term={12404431342}_{168483921980}_{714244037918}&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwl6-3BhBWEiwApN6_khH9IIdos-i8TA4xOkho8GLTEaOhdcg5a7-zBIvIjXxp91TBN4mQ0BoCrxEQAvD_BwE" target="_blank">Cosmos 4K SE Projector</a> takes this to the next level, with the ability to project your videos and photos in crisp 4K Dolby Vision, with a brightness technology called HybridBeam that can display content at 1,800 lumens. There&apos;s even a handle, perfect to bring along for family vacations, especially for when the kids might want to watch some shows on the Cosmos 4K SE.</p>

<p>In our brief time with the projector, it's clear that the Cosmos 4K SE is one of the best you can buy. The projector can take a 4K Dolby Vision video and scale it to 200 inches — more than enough to cover a wall in a bedroom. With its 'HybridBeam Technology', the Cosmos 4K SE can be as bright as 1,800 lumens, perfect for using it outside at night. Thanks to a coupon, you can currently buy the projector for $200 off. If you're looking for a true cinema experience, the Cosmos 4K SE will be the way to go.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/NEBULA-Projector-High-Brightness-Brightness-HybridBeam/dp/B0DBQ7XP2H" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="d6696d86-bb7f-4af1-918c-2e97bd5774d3" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="NEBULA Cosmos 4K SE Projector | $1299" data-dimension48="NEBULA Cosmos 4K SE Projector | $1299">View Deal</a></p></div>
<p>Since testing the Cosmos 4K SE for a few days, we&apos;ve found it to be a fantastic option for your front room or when traveling. Being able to use it almost anywhere with a flat surface, as well as maintaining picture quality for watching movies and playing games is second to none. In fact, I&apos;m considering replacing my LG C2 TV and using the Cosmos 4K SE full-time instead. The convenience of moving it around my home when needed is hard to resist.</p><p>Granted, this projector may be a bit steep price-wise, but for what the Cosmos 4K SE offers, you could argue that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B0DCN1FN61" target="_blank">£1299</a> is justified, especially if you like to live the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-l6VAnq8C3U" target="_blank">full van life</a>.</p><p>When you combine the brightness levels that the Cosmos 4K SE is capable of, as well as the ability to watch the best <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/music-movies-tv/apple-tv/best-apple-tv-plus-shows">Apple TV Plus shows</a>, as well as use apps like Hulu, Netflix, and YouTube thanks to Google TV, you&apos;ve got a fantastic projector that you can take anywhere, bringing the full cinema experience with you.</p>

This is the company’s effort to offer products that quickly charge multiple devices at once, wherever you are. These include:</p>
<ul><li>Anker MagGo Wireless Charging Station (3-in-1, Foldable Pad)</li><li>Anker MagGo Wireless Charger (Stand)</li><li>Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K, 35W, For Apple Watch)</li><li>Anker MagGo Power Bank (10K, Slim) <strong>out October 5</strong></li><li>Anker MagGo Magnetic Case with Stand (360° Ring Stand, For iPhone)</li></ul>

When folded, the 3-in-1 is the size of an Apple Watch — but when unfolded, three Qi chargers appear, each with a respective label to help you tell which device to place on them.</p><p>I&apos;ve been able to try out the 3-in-1 foldable, and I&apos;ve already found it to be incredibly useful and compact. I&apos;ve had it in the back pocket of my jeans when I was on a commute at the weekend that required me to be on multiple trains. Plugging the foldable into the mains with its USB-C port, followed by placing my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone">iPhone</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/airpods-pro-2-review">AirPods Pro 2</a> on them for a quick charge was very useful.</p><p>However, while the 3-in-1 foldable has already helped me on my travels, there are some other products in the new MagGo range that are also worth mentioning, available now:</p>

<p>You might not expect a case from Anker, but thanks to its standout features, it's well worth considering. The company claims it has 'Military-Grade' durability, along with a strong magnet and built-in ring stand, that lets your iPhone be propped up in portrait and landscape mode. While this case is designed for iPhone 15 Pro Max, Anker has confirmed to iMore that another version compatible with iPhone 16 will be available soon. <a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Drop-Proof-Protective-Compatible-Exclusively/dp/B0DF2R39KN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="6e7c3933-a144-4cae-9cf9-689a6d610f5f" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Anker MagGo Magnetic Case with Stand | $29.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Anker MagGo Magnetic Case with Stand | $29.99 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

If you want a top-notch mechanical keyboard to blast your way through these titles, Razer’s new Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless could be the answer.</p><p>With high-quality build materials and many customisable features (even including the ability to change how hard you press each key to activate it), this is a device for the most discerning of Mac gamers. But does its high price and lack of software support make it a questionable choice for Apple fans? Let’s find out.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-razer-huntsman-v3-pro-tenkeyless-price-and-availability"><span>Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless: Price and availability</span></h3>
<p>The Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless costs $219.99/£219.99 and is available from Razer and third-party retailers.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-razer-huntsman-v3-pro-tenkeyless-what-i-love"><span>Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless: What I love</span></h3>
<p>The Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless is priced for the top end of the market, and you definitely get a premium-feeling product for your cash. The body is made from solid plastic with an aluminium top plate, and there’s no bending or flexing anywhere you look. There’s also a crisp LED display above the arrow keys that indicates the profile that’s in use, whether caps lock or game mode are enabled, and more.</p><p>Razer has opted for textured PBT keycaps with a slightly rough texture to them, and they feel great in use and will be resistant to shining over time. They’re also backlit, and the lighting is beautifully bright and clear, making the keyboard a cinch to use in a dark room.</p><p>Underneath the keycaps are Razer’s analogue optical switches. These are linear, meaning there’s no tactile feedback when you press each one, and they offer a very fast response – ideal for high-intensity gaming. Unlike some linear switches, they’re still pretty comfortable for long typing sessions (although more tactile switches are still better suited to this).</p><p>The tenkeyless form factor is more compact than a standard keyboard layout (it chops off the numpad), and it’s a good balance for both typing and gaming. In the top-right is a volume dial with built-in mute button, plus buttons for media controls and opening the Xbox Game Bar in Windows (in macOS this does nothing). As with almost every other key, these can all be remapped in the Razer Synapse app in Windows (but not in macOS).</p>

<p>As we’ll discuss in the next section, Razer’s Synapse app – which is used to customise many of the keyboard’s features – doesn’t work with macOS. But Razer has a solution of sorts, in that you can adjust key actuation, switch profiles, and enable and adjust the Rapid Trigger and Snap Tap features using keyboard shortcuts. This is a little clunkier than using the app, but it means that Mac users don’t miss out on these features entirely.</p><p>The ability to tweak key actuation levels – that is, how far you need to press a key for its input to be registered – is really useful, as it means you can make the keys feel as heavy or as light as you like (and they can be made incredibly light). To use this feature in macOS, you press the Function and Tab keys, then twist the volume dial or use the arrow keys. The LED display shows your chosen key actuation level (such as “1.2” for 1.2mm). You can also press a key to test your chosen actuation level, then press Esc or Function and Tab to save your changes directly to the keyboard (which means they’ll carry over to any Mac or PC you connect the keyboard to).</p><p>There’s a similar feature for Rapid Trigger mode, which lets you re-activate a key without fully letting go and allowing it to return to its unpressed position. You press Function and Caps Lock, then press Caps Lock again to highlight currently active Rapid Trigger keys. Spin the volume dial to adjust their sensitivity, or try tapping them to test them out – their backlighting goes green when the key is actuated and red when it’s reset.</p>

<p>Similarly, Snap Tap is enabled by pressing Function and Left Shift. This lets you press and hold one key, then tap another and both keys will alternate (e.g. hold A and tap B and the output will be ABABABAB). Unfortunately, without Synapse you can’t tell when it’s on or off except by testing it, as there’s no visual indication.</p><p>Finally, you can also switch profiles using just the keyboard. Press Function and one of the six keys in the top-right corner (Home, End, etc) – each one has a corresponding profile number printed on its keycap. The LED display’s profile icon will change colour when you change profiles. You can pick from one of five pre-made profiles, each with custom actuation levels, Rapid Trigger settings and more, and the profiles include ones for FPS games, racing titles, a high-sensitivity mode, and more.</p><p>Being able to customise things with just the keyboard takes a lot of the pain out of the lack of Synapse compatibility, and Razer’s implementation is very easy to use and understand. While we’d prefer to use Synapse, adjusting things on the keyboard itself means you don’t miss out on a lot of these excellent gaming features.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-razer-huntsman-v3-pro-tenkeyless-what-i-don-t-love"><span>Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless: What I don’t love</span></h3>
<p>Let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Razer Synapse. Razer’s companion app is used to customise all of its products, and the Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless is no different. You use Synapse to change key actuation levels, enable features like Snap Tap and Rapid Trigger, tweak the lighting mode, and more.</p><p>The problem? Synapse doesn’t work with macOS. That means a sizeable range of features – many of which are core elements of the Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless – are unavailable to Mac users. That includes enabling Continuous Rapid Trigger (but not the regular Rapid Trigger) mode, remapping keys, creating new profiles, setting macros and creating advanced lighting patterns. As we’ve seen, though, the good news is that many of the keyboard’s essential features can be enabled without requiring Synapse. Still, you might feel that the keyboard’s price is a little too high to justify without Synapse.</p>

<p>There are a few other issues of note. There’s only one switch option (linear) and the switches are not hot-swappable. The typing sound might displease mechanical keyboard purists, too – it’s loud, clunky and heavy. The palm rest is also very firm (some people will like this, while others might not). While it magnetically attaches to the keyboard along its top edge, it lacks clips holding it in place, so it can slide from side to side. Finally, there’s no way to enable the macOS keyboard layout, so certain keys (such as Command) are not where you expect them to be.</p><p>But none of these issues are as pressing as the lack of Synapse support in macOS. We’ve spoken to Razer about this repeatedly in the past and they’ve always assured us that macOS support is on their to-do list. We followed up again regarding the Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless and received the same reply: future support is possible, but there’s nothing definite just yet. The sooner support arrives, the better.</p>
<h3 class="article-body__section" id="section-razer-huntsman-v3-pro-tenkeyless-competition"><span>Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless: Competition</span></h3>
<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://steelseries.com/gaming-keyboards/apex-pro-tkl-2023">SteelSeries Apex Pro TKL</a> is another tenkeyless mechanical keyboard built with customisable actuation and a rapid trigger function. Like the Razer Huntsman V3 Pro Tenkeyless, it comes with backlit PBT keycaps, an adjustable stand and an on-board display. It’s a little more affordable at $189.99/£189.99.</p><p>If the gamer aesthetic isn’t quite your thing but you still want many of the same features as Razer’s keyboard, the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.keychron.uk/products/keychron-q1-he-qmk-wireless-custom-keyboard">Keychron Q1 HE QMK</a> is a much more subdued affair. You’ll still get a control dial and customisable actuation points, but in a more mature look. It also features hot-swappable switches with magnetic activation, a gasket mount design and a button to alternate between macOS and Windows layouts. It’s priced at $219/£193.</p>

<p>A really solid keyboard with some excellent high-end gaming features and plenty of on-board customisation. it’s mostly just the price and lack of macOS support for the Synapse app that’s holding it back.</p>

<p>If you still own an Apple device that has a Lightning port, but you have other products that require a USB-C cable to charge, HyperJuice has uniquely solved this dilemma. For $29.99, you can charge two devices with different ports all at once, without having to carry a Lightning cable.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.com/HyperJuice-USB-Lightning-Cable-Tangle-Free/dp/B0DBM7W6Y2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="e92ce7b1-2180-459a-a371-f39aeb3441a8" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="HyperJuice USB C and Lightning Cable | $29.99 at Amazon" data-dimension48="HyperJuice USB C and Lightning Cable | $29.99 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>With retro gaming emulators and AAA games like Resident Evil available to play on iPhone and iPad, a controller like GameSir's G8+ is essential to play these as you would on a gaming console. Every button has a premium feel to it, akin to a Sony DualSense controller, and the analog sticks can be changed to fit the game you're playing.

<p>Sometimes, it's not all about looks, as Chargeasap's Flash Pro Plus power bank proves. It's able to store 25000mAh of power, meaning you can charge an iPhone 16 Pro up to six times on its own. But thanks to its six USB-C ports and two wireless chargers, you can juice up six devices at once, making this power bank perfect for a vacation.<a class="view-deal button" href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Chargeasap-High-Capacity-25000mAh-Graphene-Charging/dp/B0CD7ZVXTC" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" data-dimension112="ceffd07f-1988-440c-9039-be3aac2b26ef" data-action="Deal Block" data-label="Chargeasap Flash Pro Plus | £258 at Amazon" data-dimension48="Chargeasap Flash Pro Plus | £258 at Amazon">View Deal</a></p></div>

<p>With Cevaton, you're playing with power thanks to these portable monitors.

While it is advertised as the 2nd generation of visionOS, the new software seems like a smaller update, intended to make the experience of using <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro/apple-vision-pro-review">Apple Vision Pro</a> every day just a little better.</p><p>visionOS 2 now lets users turn their existing 2D photos into spatial photos using the power of AI. VisionOS 2 also features new controls to open the Home view and quick access to the Control Center.</p><p>Later this year Apple, will add higher display resolutions and sizes for its Mac external display feature, including Ultra wide, the equivalent of two 4K monitors side-by-side.</p><p>To update to visionOS 2, head into the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device. Go to <strong>General</strong> and then <strong>Software Update</strong>. You&apos;ll see the option for visionOS 2 available, then press <strong>Update Now</strong>. Note that updates may take a while to install while the update is so new, as many users will be scrambling to download it.</p><p>We recommend making an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/how-back-your-iphone-or-ipad#:~:text=iCloud%20backups%20are%20stored%20in,backups%20on%20to%20access%20them." target="_blank">iCloud backup</a> of all your important content. From spatial videos to apps and backgrounds, it&apos;s always a good idea to prepare your Vision Pro before updating its software.</p>
<h2 id="what-else-is-new-in-visionos-2-2">What else is new in visionOS 2?</h2>
<p>Apple&apos;s Travel mode also now supports trains, as well as planes, a response perhaps to the well publicized videos of people trying to use the device on New York City subwways.</p><p>Developers are also getting some love, with new features and APIs to create new apps, including Volumetric APIs and a new TabletopKit that lets apps anchor to flat surfaces, perfect for creating board games and the like. </p><p>Apple is also making it easier for users to create spatial content. One notable introduction is a new Spatial lens for the Canon EOS R7. Apple has also announced a new Vimeo app for Vision Pro and a new partnership with Blackmagic Design. VisionPro is getting new extreme sports experiences from Redbull, and new titles are also coming to the Apple TV app.</p>

<h2 id="which-apple-watch-models-support-watchos-11-2">Which Apple Watch models support watchOS 11?</h2>
<p>As always with new software, Apple has ceased support for some older models of the wearable. Here are the Apple Watches that have been dropped since watchOS 10:</p>
<ul><li>Apple Watch Series 4</li><li>Apple Watch Series 5</li><li>Apple Watch SE (1st generation)</li></ul>
<p>Still not entirely sure if you&apos;re going to be able to use watchOS 11 when it comes out later this year? Here are all the watches we know will work with the latest version of watchOS:</p>
<ul><li>Apple Watch SE (2nd generation)</li><li>Apple Watch Series 6</li><li>Apple Watch Series 7</li><li>Apple Watch Series 8</li><li>Apple Watch Series 9</li><li>Apple Watch Ultra</li><li>Apple Watch Ultra 2</li></ul>
<p>Apple says on its website that not all of these watches will support all of the features, thanks to some not having certain sensors that are necessary like blood oxygen measuring.

After several months of beta releases, Apple is today finally rolling out iOS 18 and iPadOS 18 to everyone – just in time for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16</a> release.</p><p>Aside from the focus of <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/apple-ai-everything-you-need-to-know-about-artificial-intelligence-changes-coming-to-iphone-ios-18-and-beyond">Apple Intelligence</a>, there&apos;s a redesigned Photos app, there are more customization options for your Home Screen (begone, grid!) and icons can be tinted. RCS messaging is also now available, too. </p><p>To update to iOS 18 or iPadOS 18 head into the <strong>Settings</strong> app on your device. Go to <strong>General</strong> and then <strong>Software Update</strong>. If you don&apos;t see iOS 18 immediately, select the option at the top of your screen where you can pick between iOS 17 and iOS 18. Note that updates may take a while to install while the update is so new, as many users will be scrambling to download it.</p><p>We recommend making an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/how-back-your-iphone-or-ipad#:~:text=iCloud%20backups%20are%20stored%20in,backups%20on%20to%20access%20them.">iCloud backup</a> of all your important content. From photos to videos, it&apos;s always a good idea to prepare your iPhone before updating its software.</p>
<h2 id="no-apple-intelligence-features-just-yet-2">No Apple Intelligence features just yet</h2>
<p>As you might expect, the headline feature of iOS 18 is the new Apple Intelligence suite of AI features – but you won&apos;t find it in the first release of iOS 18. Apple Intelligence will be available on iPhone 16, iPhone 16 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro later this year, offering features like live transcribing, Writing Tools, generative image creation, and more. </p><p>It also features new emergency features like Messages Via Satellite and Emergency SOS Live Video, as well as Roadside Assistance via Satellite. </p><p>Apple Intelligence will debut as part of iOS 18.1 and beyond in October. The first rollouts will be U.S. English only, with localizations for English in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, and the U.K. coming in December. There&apos;s support for Chinese, French, Japanese, and Spanish coming next year, too. </p>

With &apos;Repair Assistant&apos;, users can now pair genuine parts, such as a display, battery, camera module, and more, with an iPhone themselves, or by a third-party repair provider. Previously, this step of the repair process was handled by Apple, but <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18-rumored-features-supported-devices-and-more">iOS 18</a> enables users to complete the step solo. Apple says that &apos;Repair Assistant&apos; only works with iPhone 12 models and later.</p><p>In addition, iOS 18 allows users to check any replacement parts by going to <strong>Settings</strong> > <strong>About</strong> > <strong>Parts and Service</strong>. </p><p>This update is packed with new features, including the ability to customize your Home Screen with dark app icons, as well as the ability to place your apps anywhere. iOS 18 is set to be released later today for <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18/ios18-compatible-devices">compatible iPhones</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-win-for-everyone-especially-for-retail-workers-2">A win for everyone, especially for retail workers</h2>
<p>In what feels like a previous life, I used to work as tech support for a phone store, fixing software issues on countless smartphones and tablets. Often, customers would bring in iPhones that couldn&apos;t be fixed on-site.  In these cases, we had to send the handset off for diagnosis through the store&apos;s repair program. Once a technician looked at the iPhone, we&apos;d receive a quote for the repair. If the customer accepted it, the device would be fixed — but the whole process would take at least three weeks.</p><p>Being without a device like an iPhone for that long is frustrating, especially if it&apos;s used for work. From experience, I can say that retail staff often bore the brunt of frustrations from customers with these long turnaround times.</p><p>Now, with &apos;Repair Assistant&apos; in <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ios/ios-18-rumored-features-supported-devices-and-more">iOS 18</a>, that frustration will mostly become a thing of the past. Customers will have greater flexibility to repair their iPhones as third-party repair shops will be able to pair a used genuine part without having to send the device off to Apple. This reduces the risk of compatibility issues with parts and saves valuable time for the customer.</p><p>Ultimately, this new change benefits everyone. Customers will enjoy faster repairs, and retail staff can guide them to local repair services — or, if they&apos;re comfortable, customers can buy a part and attempt a repair themselves.</p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>New reports suggest that the Apple Watch SE 3 is still in &apos;active development&apos;, and will feature a new casing.</p><p>According to Mark Gurman&apos;s &apos;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-15/apple-s-hearing-aid-sleep-apnea-saved-iphone-16-event-m4-mac-launch-details-m13kkabb" target="_blank">Power On</a>&apos; newsletter at Bloomberg, a "new Apple Watch SE with plastic shell remains in development", with the company intending to bring down the price of the wearable with this more affordable material. Gurman also anticipates this new SE will come equipped with a new chip, but didn&apos;t say whether it would be the S10 chip, currently found in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, which is set to be made available on Friday (September 20).</p><p>There had been rumors that an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-se-3">Apple Watch SE 3</a> would be announced at Apple&apos;s &apos;It&apos;s Glowtime&apos; event on September 9, but that didn&apos;t come to pass. Instead, Apple unveiled the Apple Watch Series 10 and introduced a new Satin Black finish for the existing Apple Watch Ultra 2. </p><p>The current SE model has been available since 2022, but doesn&apos;t have an ECG to help measure your heart&apos;s electrical activity, nor does it have an always-on screen. A plastic casing could lower the SE&apos;s price while introducing features like ECG at a more affordable price.  </p><p>Still, the current Apple Watch SE remains a great purchase, especially as a Christmas gift for anyone new to Apple&apos;s wearables.</p>
<h2 id="how-much-could-the-price-drop-for-the-apple-watch-se-3-2">How much could the price drop for the Apple Watch SE 3?</h2>
<p>Apple Watch SE has always been positioned as the cheaper model in the entire Watch line. It&apos;s the entry point for anyone looking to explore the benefits of an Apple Watch for the first time, especially to see if it can help with their health and fitness. At $249 / £219, it&apos;s a good price, but the SE faces fierce competition from wearables such as <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Smartwatch-Readiness-Exercise-Tracking/dp/B0B4MWCFV4" target="_blank">Fitbit&apos;s Versa 4</a>, which includes ECG heart rate and sleep tracking for $199. </p><p>Switching the material from aluminum to plastic could be a key move to help drive the price down of the Apple Watch SE 3, potentially below $199 — perhaps even toward $149. If Apple manages to incorporate ECG and sleep tracking in this new model, these efforts could make the Apple Watch SE 3 a very enticing buy for someone on a budget.</p>

<h2 id="could-your-iphone-outperform-your-laptop-2">Could your iPhone outperform your laptop?</h2>
<p>While the caveat of this being a benchmark and not real-world testing naturally applies, it&apos;s interesting that the A18 Pro, found in a device you can carry in your pocket, is now starting to compete with Apple&apos;s laptop and desktop chips (albeit those from a few years ago).</p><p>With M1 benchmarking around 8300 for multi-core performance, the A18 Pro is seemingly a hair more impressive, and while the comparison may seem like apples to oranges to some, it shows just how far Apple has come in just a few years - let alone the rest of the industry which is keeping pace or following closely behind.</p><p>In case you missed it, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/apple-chip-boss-confirms-how-much-ram-is-in-iphone-16-and-16-pro">Apple&apos;s Johny Srouji confirmed Apple&apos;s latest iPhone models have 8GB of RAM</a>, too - the same as the base M1 chip.</p>

<h2 id="the-end-of-an-era-2">The end of an era</h2>
<p>As 9to5Mac points out, it seems Apple won&apos;t be offering stickers across any products soon.</p><p>The company didn&apos;t include them in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-pro-2024-review">M4 iPad Air</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/ipad/ipad-air-2024-review">M2 iPad Air</a>, or the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro">Vision Pro</a>, but it&apos;s still a little bit of whimsy the company has seemingly left behind in its understandable pursuit of environmental goals. </p><p>Apple still aims to become carbon neutral by 2030, with this year marking the removal of additional plastic from iPhone packaging.</p><p>What did you do with your old Apple stickers? I&apos;m pretty sure I have a bundle of them somewhere - who knows, they might be worth something one day!</p>

<p>“Our goal is to build the best products, delivering the absolute best user experience. As it relates to Apple Intelligence, DRAM is one aspect. And when we look at what we’re building, whether it’s silicon, hardware, or software, we don’t want to be wasteful in many ways," Srouji explains.</p><p>"We have lots of data that tells us what is going to enable a certain feature, and Apple Intelligence is one of those very, very important features that we want to enable."</p><p>"And we look at different configurations, both for computation and memory bandwidth and memory capacity. And then we make the right trade-off and balance of what actually makes the most sense. So, Apple Intelligence was a major feature that led us to believe that we need to get to 8GB."</p><p>Srouji also notes how 8GB of RAM will help other facets of the iPhone experience, including "high-end, AAA-titled games".</p><p>He also extolled the virtues of Apple&apos;s efficiency cores, pointing to single-thread performance throughout the Apple lineup.</p><p>“When you look at the single-thread of performance core across all of our silicon, it’s the absolute best in the industry. We’re leading the industry. If you look at the efficiency cores, same, we’re at the absolute best. We’re leading in a big way."</p>

<p>In many ways this is the logical next step after the same principles have already been applied to the iOS platform, but it&apos;s still noteworthy as this means iOS, iPadOS and (as always) macOS will now allow sideloading - at least in Europe.</p><p>Apple was given six months to ensure iPadOS would be DMA compliant, and the company confirmed it would oblige in May of this year.</p><p>Epic Games&apos; storefront is available for EU users, meaning <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/gaming/ios-games/fortnite-is-finally-back-on-the-iphone-but-only-if-you-live-in-the-eu-and-use-the-new-epic-games-store">they can install Fortnite on iOS</a>, but the developer has expressed an interest in bringing it back to iPad, too.</p>

This includes a new &apos;Camera Control&apos; button on both models, enabling users to quickly access a camera app and camera functions, as well as a faster A18 and A18 Pro chip respectively.</p><p>With these new phones now available to pre-order, Apple has also brought down the price of other iPhones in the lineup, such as the iPhone 15, last year&apos;s flagship — now available for $699.</p><p>However, if you&apos;ve decided to hold off on upgrading, you can also pre-order the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch-ultra/apple-watch-ultra-2-now-comes-in-gorgeous-satin-black">Apple Watch Ultra 2 in Satin Black</a>, AirPods Max USB-C, and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering is a simple affair, much like in previous years. Your best option is to do it through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/us/shop/goto/buy_iphone/iphone_16" target="_blank">Apple Store</a> and the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-store/id375380948" target="_blank">Apple Store app</a>. Once you&apos;ve selected your <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16</a> or <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/apples-iphone-16-pro-is-here">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, you can choose whether to have <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/uk/support/products/iphone/" target="_blank">AppleCare Plus</a>, which extends the handset&apos;s warranty to three years and includes accidental damage protection.</p><p>If you&apos;re on a carrier plan, these companies likely have some enticing deals to tempt you to upgrade to the new iPhones. In the U.S., carriers like <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.att.com/buy/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro.html" target="_blank">AT&T</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.verizon.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-16-pro/" target="_blank">Verizon</a> are <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/atandt-reveals-its-iphone-16-deals-get-up-to-dollar1000-off-with-an-eligible-trade-in">already offering some great trade-in deals</a>. Meanwhile, in the UK, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.o2.co.uk/shop/apple/iphone-16-pro?setTTSelectedStack=360" target="_blank">O2</a> is offering double data on new and upgraded contracts. In addition, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.three.co.uk/shop/phones/apple-iphone-16-pro" target="_blank">Three</a> is offering up to £747 when trading an older iPhone for a new handset. If you&apos;re also looking at an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.three.co.uk/shop/smart-watches/apple-watch-series-10-46mm-sm">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, Three is offering the wearable for a £25 upfront cost, followed by £18.17 per month, with six months of free smartwatch pairing when a customer takes a 24-month smartwatch pairing plan on its network. As you can see, there are already plenty of appealing deals out there if you want the phones and other products on a monthly plan.</p><p>However, we recommend acting fast if you want a certain color — the new Desert Titanium shade, exclusive to iPhone 16 Pro and iPhone 16 Pro Max, is likely to sell out fast, potentially delaying its shipping date from September 20 to October.</p><p>If you&apos;ve decided which iPhone you&apos;re getting, let us know in the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://forums.imore.com/?utm_source=im&utm_medium=drawer&utm_campaign=navigation&_ga=2.245320390.2126104595.1651594974-1068404256.1645462739" target="_blank">iMore Forums</a>!</p>

The biggest feature coming to the earbuds is the ability to use them as clinical-grade over-the-counter hearing aids.</p><p>The one thing Apple needed was FDA clearance for the feature, and now the company has it. In a <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-authorizes-first-over-counter-hearing-aid-software">press release</a>, the FDA announced that it has provided clearance for AirPods Pro 2 to serve as a hearing aid. In the announcement, the agency said "Once installed and customized to the user’s hearing needs, the Hearing Aid Feature enables compatible versions of the AirPods Pro to serve as an OTC hearing aid, intended to amplify sounds for individuals 18 years or older with perceived mild to moderate hearing impairment. "</p><p>In a statement, Michelle Tarver, M.D., Ph.D., acting director of the FDA&apos;s Center for Devices and Radiological Health said "Today’s marketing authorization of an over-the-counter hearing aid software on a widely used consumer audio product is another step that advances the availability, accessibility and acceptability of hearing support for adults with perceived mild to moderate hearing loss.” </p>
<h2 id="there-apos-s-even-more-coming-to-airpods-pro-2-2">There&apos;s even more coming to AirPods Pro 2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:300px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:133.33%;"><img id="N3g5skx3kc5Qimn9nXcAzW" name="4.jpg" alt="airpods pro 2 on a white background" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/N3g5skx3kc5Qimn9nXcAzW.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="300" height="400" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The hearing aid industry is a huge one. According to the FDA, "more than 30 million American adults report some degree of hearing loss," so this is an industry that is ripe for disruption and Apple is in a perfect place to do so.</p><p>While being able to use your AirPods Pro 2 as a hearing aid is certainly the biggest feature coming to the earbuds this fall with iOS 18, there are two other major health features on the way. The first is Hearing Protection which is on by default and ensures that you don&apos;t blast your audio so loud that you cause permanent damage to your ears. In fact, you can now use AirPods Pro 2 as earplugs at live concerts.</p><p>The other feature coming to the AirPods Pro 2 is a hearing test that anyone can take from home to test the health of their hearing. Apple says that the test is "clinically validated" and can be performed in just five minutes at home. The company says that the test uses real-world data and builds on the learning it has made with its Apple Study programs. Once you are finished with the test, you&apos;ll get a personalized hearing profile.</p><p>While AirPods 4 might be the only "new" AirPods the company is releasing this fall, AirPods Pro 2 might even feel like new with all of these new features. Hooray, earbuds becoming updatable products!</p>

Turns out the iPhone 16 lineup supports 45W charging via USB-C across the board. That&apos;s a big increase on the 29W supported by the previous generation. </p>
<h2 id="iphone-16-apos-s-big-charging-upgrade-2">iPhone 16&apos;s big charging upgrade</h2>
<p>The news, spotted by <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-pro-release-date-rumors-news-and-more" target="_blank">ShrimpApplePro on X</a>, is exciting for prospective iPhone owners for two reasons. Not only is this a big jump on the current wired charging speeds, letting you power up your phone faster than ever before, but it&apos;s also rare to see hefty upgrades like this applied to the entire lineup. We&apos;d expected <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16-pro-release-date-rumors-news-and-more">iPhone 16 Pro</a> to support faster charging, so the revelation that all four phones are getting the upgrade is great news. </p><p>Likewise, Apple has also beefed up MagSafe charging with iPhone 16. Each model now supports charging up to 25W via MagSafe, compared to 15W in the previous generation models. Coupled with big battery life gains, iPhone 16 users can expect their phones to last for longer day-to-day, and for charging to take less time when that juice does run out. </p><p>Another major reason for the more power-efficient performance is the advent of the new A18 chip, which uses much less energy at similar speeds compared to the previous A17 Pro in the iPhone 15 Pro, and the A16 in the iPhone 15. </p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/where-to-pre-order-iphone-16-when-and-where-we-think-youll-be-able-to-buy-apples-next-flagship">iPhone 16 pre-orders</a> begin Friday, with pricing across the lineup identical to last year&apos;s models. </p>

When submitting an app to Apple&apos;s App Store, developers have to follow specific guidelines in order for Apple to approve their app. The company <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/ios/submit/" target="_blank">has a page</a> all about this process, but it&apos;s the change in requirements at the &apos;<a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/product-page/" target="_blank">Product Page</a>&apos; stage that Tigas noticed.</p><p>This could suggest that Apple&apos;s budget iPhone SE handset could be refreshed soon.

<p>If you&apos;re holding out for an iPhone SE 4, there are plenty more features rumored to be in store.

Headline upgrades for the iPhone 16 include the new Camera Control button and a powerful A18 chip that delivers hefty performance gains over the iPhone 15, powering gaming and AI features through Apple Intelligence. Likewise, the iPhone 16 Pro gets a boost thanks to new screen sizes, an A18 Pro chip, and better battery life across the board. </p><p>AT&T is offering its usual suite of trade-in deals and discounts, with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/where-to-pre-order-iphone-16-when-and-where-we-think-youll-be-able-to-buy-apples-next-flagship">iPhone 16 pre-orders</a> opening on Friday, September 13.</p>

According to supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will release both the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch SE 3 next year. The leaker says "Apple Watch Ultra 3 was absent from this year&apos;s media event, which is in line with my prediction from about a year ago...The 2025 new Apple Watch models will include the Ultra 3 and SE upgrade version."</p>

<p>While we don&apos;t know much about what to expect from the Apple Watch Ultra 3 and the Apple Watch SE 3, you should be safe in assuming they might pick up some of the features that were announced with the Apple Watch Series 10.</p><p>For one, they&apos;ll likely adopt the new Wide Angle OLED screen shipping on the Series 10 which makes the screen 40% brighter when glancing at it from an angle. It&apos;s also more power efficient, allowing the Always On display to refresh every second instead of every minute.</p><p>The Apple Watch Ultra will also most definitely support Sleep Apnea detection — especially since that feature is also coming to the second generation of the Apple Watch Ultra. It&apos;s a toss-up whether or not it will come to the Apple Watch SE 3, though. Apple seems to reserve some health features for its flagship models.</p><p>I&apos;m sure we&apos;ll learn more leaks about the Ultra 3 and SE 3 as we make our way through 2025!</p>

Firmware version 7A294 replaces version 6F8 and is available for both the USB-C and Lightning versions of the wireless earbuds. Unlike the previous betas, this update is available for all AirPods Pro users.</p><p>The update likely brings with it the usual round of bug fixes and performance improvements along with a number of features that are coming with iOS 18 when it launches to everyone on Monday, September 16th.</p>
<h2 id="ios-18-brings-new-features-to-airpods-pro-2-2">iOS 18 brings new features to AirPods Pro 2</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:4608px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.25%;"><img id="mHVDHtvzAqKEX27xhRFgbg" name="P1018725.JPG" alt="AirPods Pro 2" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/mHVDHtvzAqKEX27xhRFgbg.jpg" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="4608" height="2592" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Mike Sawh)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first feature now available on AirPods Pro 2 through the firmware (once your iPhone is running iOS 18) is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/siri">Siri</a> Interactions, the new feature that lets you shake or nod your head to interact with Siri announcements while you&apos;re wearing your earbuds. As Apple explains, "Siri Interactions allow users to answer or dismiss calls, interact with messages, manage notifications, and so much more — all without speaking."</p><p>Voice Isolation is also available with iOS 18 which Apple is bringing directly to the earbuds after originally launching the feature on the iPhone, iPad, and Mac. The company says "machine learning, running on the H2 chip in AirPods Pro and the paired iPhone, iPad, or Mac, isolates and enhances voice quality while removing significant background noise — like wind around the caller — for the listener."</p><p>The last feature available now through the firmware update is Personalized Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking for games. While that is also coming to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods-3">AirPods 3</a> and <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods-max-review">AirPods Max</a>, the company is reserving "improved voice quality, including 16-bit, 48kHz audio" for games with AirPods Pro 2.</p><p>AirPods Pro 2 are also <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-unveils-surprise-new-health-features-for-the-airpods-pro-2">getting a number of new health features</a> this fall including the ability to use the earbuds as a clinical-grade hearing aid. You can also take a hearing test and get a completely personalized audio profile. </p>

Instead of moving on to the iPhone 16 Pro from the iPhone 15 Pro, I&apos;m <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/im-downgrading-from-my-iphone-15-pro-to-the-iphone-16-heres-why">planning on preordering the iPhone 16</a>. Instead of getting that sweet Satin Black Apple Watch Ultra 2, I <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/the-apple-watch-series-10-has-me-considering-a-downgrade-from-my-apple-watch-ultra">preordered the Apple Watch Series 10</a> in Jet Black.</p><p>And now, I&apos;m even considering ditching my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/airpods-pro-2-review">AirPods Pro 2</a> for the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a>. I already have a preorder in and am ready to potentially replace the last Pro Apple product I will have (after I switch from the Pro iPhone to the Apple Watch Ultra which is basically the Pro Apple Watch).</p><p>With AirPods Pro 2 getting some software upgrades and still having what seemingly will be better noise cancellation, why would I get rid of them? Well, it has to do with two things.</p>
<h2 id="noise-cancellation-and-fit-are-the-factors-2">Noise cancellation and fit are the factors</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="7aCgSoefvCC2c8PZEYAXwH" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 18.30.53.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7aCgSoefvCC2c8PZEYAXwH.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The first reason — and the big reason — I&apos;m considering a switch from the AirPods Pro 2 is due to the fit. While the AirPods Pro 2 are great, the biggest issue I&apos;ve always had with them is that they — whenever I&apos;ve done any kind of exercise or chewed gum too much — would fall out of my ears.</p><p>If I go for a run, I&apos;m going to be adjusting the ear tips of the AirPods Pro over and over and over again. If I go for a hike, it&apos;s going to be the same deal. And don&apos;t even try to do sit-ups or push-ups — those babies are coming out regardless of how much I try to secure them.</p><p>I&apos;ve found that open-ear earbuds are more comfortable, so I really want to give the AirPods 4 a try to see if they not only live up to this but if they actually end up being more secure in my ears. That&apos;s a big ask since AirPods Pro 2 offer four different ear tips for a more custom fit, but I&apos;ve heard from multiple people that the regular AirPods have actually stayed in their ears better than the Pros did. I&apos;ll have to see if I fall into that camp as well.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="DxJQQHsr2F6xBVi5PD72dj" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 18.27.59.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/DxJQQHsr2F6xBVi5PD72dj.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The second reason I&apos;m considering a switch is that the AirPods 4 are getting the one feature that I really stuck with the AirPods Pro for: noise cancellation. This is the most important feature of my earbuds, and I&apos;m sure I&apos;m not the only one. Being able to drown out external noise when trying to focus at work, on a plane, or during a workout is a required feature nowadays.</p><p>With noise cancellation coming to the AirPods 4 with that open-ear design, I&apos;m wondering if they&apos;ll be a better choice for someone like me who has fit and comfort issues with the AirPods Pro 2. I know the AirPods 4&apos;s noise cancellation won&apos;t be as good as the noise cancellation on the AirPods Pro 2 but as long as they are good enough, I&apos;ll sacrifice a little bit of performance here.</p><p>So that&apos;s where I&apos;m at. If the AirPods 4&apos;s noise cancellation is good enough for my use cases and fix my fit and comfort issues with the AirPods Pro 2, they could make me jump once again from a Pro to a non-Pro Apple product.</p><p>We&apos;ll see what happens when they come out on September 20th. I have my preorder in now!</p>

But there was a surprise new product from Beats that didn&apos;t get mentioned in the keynote: iPhone 16 cases.</p><p>These Beats-branded cases are meant to protect your precious new device, naturally. They’re rocking a hardshell polycarbonate back,” which is essentially tough plastic that’ll probably survive a decent drop. The real kicker, though? They’re compatible with Camera Control, which is a huge plus.</p><p>Of course, Apple didn’t forget MagSafe – these cases are fully kitted out with that too. Plus, Apple wants you to know they’re “precisely crafted” for the iPhone 16. So, they should hug your phone like a second skin, caressing its buttons and edges with the utmost care.</p><p>If you fancy a bit of choice, you’ve got four colourways to pick from: <em>Midnight Black</em>, <em>Summit Stone</em>, <em>Riptide Blue</em>, and <em>Sunset Purple</em>. At $49 a pop (that’s about £39 or €46), they’re right in line with Apple’s other offerings, but with that Beats flavour sprinkled in. If you’re quick on the draw, you might even get one in hand as soon as Wednesday.</p>

There&apos;s a new Camera Control on the new iPhones, which gives better access to taking photos and videos. The screens across the line-up are better than ever, and more durable. Apple is showing a fondness for new colors this year, with plenty of options to pick from.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a> was a big upgrade, with a bigger screen than ever before.

In the iPhone 16 keynote, Apple said the new devices have bigger batteries, but didn&apos;t go into the specifics. Now, we can see the battery life stats offer hours of extra battery.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro Max now gives you up to 33 hours of video playback, while its smaller sibling, the 16 Pro, stretches to 27 hours. The iPhone 16 Plus also clocks in at 27 hours for video, and even the regular iPhone 16 can handle up to 22 hours.</p><p>If you’re all about audio, the Pro Max takes the lead again with a staggering 105 hours of playback, with the others offering anywhere from 80 to 100 hours, depending on the model.</p><p>The iPhone 16 series doesn’t just settle for battery life improvements, either; it’s also packing faster charging, thanks to a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-magsafe-charging-stands">MagSafe charger</a> that supports Qi2 wireless charging. If you were tired of watching your battery percentage crawl up slowly, this is the fix you&apos;ve been waiting for with 25W speeds.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-the-iphone-16-battery-compare-to-iphone-15-2">How does the iPhone 16 battery compare to iPhone 15?</h2>
<p>The biggest leap in battery life comes with the Pro models. The iPhone 16 Pro Max gets 4 extra hours of video playback compared to the iPhone 15 Pro Max, taking it from 29 to 33 hours. Audio playback also jumps by 10 hours, from 95 to 105.</p><p>The iPhone 16 Pro follows a similar trend, with video playback climbing from 23 to 27 hours and audio playback ticking up from 75 to 85 hours.</p><p>For the iPhone 16 Plus, the difference is more subtle. Video playback goes from 26 to 27 hours, while audio remains steady at 100 hours, just like the iPhone 15 and 14 Plus.</p><p>The standard iPhone 16 offers more noticeable improvements over its predecessors, with video playback increasing to 22 hours – 2 more than the iPhone 15 and 14, and 3 more than the iPhone 13. Audio playback stays the same as the iPhone 15 and 14 at 80 hours, but it still surpasses the iPhone 13’s 75 hours.</p><p>Whichever of the new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-iphone">best iPhones</a> you get, you can be sure that your shiny new iPhone 15 will give you a good few extra hours of battery.</p>

Good news, the newest bands are compatible with older Apple Watch models.</p><p>The Milanese Loop and Link Bracelet have been given a little makeover to perfectly match the new titanium cases. No more mismatched metals ruining your watch aesthetic. And for those with a taste for the finer things in life, there’s a new Hermès collection, because of course there is. This includes their first metal band, the “Grand H.”</p><p>Nike’s also back in the mix, with updated Sport bands in some new colours for when you want to feel sporty, even if you’re just heading to the shops. Oh, and for the bougiest of the bunch, the Apple Watch Ultra has now gone full-on Hermès, complete with a water-resistant “En Mer” band and an exclusive Regatta countdown face.</p><p>Now, there were whispers that Apple might force us all to buy new straps for the Series 10 by tweaking the connector, but that’s not happening. Your old bands, whether they’re for the 41mm or 45mm models, will still fit the new 42mm and 46mm versions. And vice versa. So, if you’ve already invested in a small fortune of Apple Watch straps, rest easy.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16</a> launch event saw plenty of announcements from Apple. There&apos;s a new Camera Control on the new iPhones, which gives better access to taking photos and videos. The screens across the line-up are better than ever, and more durable. Apple is showing a fondness for new colors this year, with plenty of options to pick from.</p><p>Apple Watch Series 10 was a big upgrade, with a bigger screen than ever before. The body is the slimmest it&apos;s ever been, things are faster on the inside, and moves the antennas to the backside of the case. Apple Watch Ultra 2 got a new colour option, and a third-gen Apple Watch SE never materialized.</p><p>AirPods also saw some big changes. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a> gain active noise cancellation, and launch an even cheaper $129 model without ANC. AirPods Max get a minor refresh with USB-C and new colours, while AirPods Pro 2 got a third iteration with new hearing tech added.</p>

It marks the end of a 10-year battle over Apple&apos;s tax payments in Ireland, and questions over whether Apple had been given illegal tax benefits from the country over the course of some 20 years. Adding some strangeness to the case, both Apple and Ireland have protested the ruling, which would see Apple on the hook for (and Ireland in benefit of) 13 billion euros.</p><p>The EU originally ruled against Apple in 2016 following a two-year investigation, a ruling annulled by the EU General Court in 2020 following an appeal from Apple and Ireland. Now, the European Court of Justice, the bloc&apos;s highest legal body, has set aside that ruling. </p>
<h2 id="apple-apos-s-eu-tax-saga-finally-over-2">Apple&apos;s EU tax saga finally over</h2>
<p>The money at stake has been held in escrow for some ten years, so the material impact on Apple should be minimal. However, Apple remains defiant against the verdict. In a statement to iMore, the company said "This case has never been about how much tax we pay, but which government we are required to pay it to. We always pay all the taxes we owe wherever we operate and there has never been a special deal. Apple is proud to be an engine of growth and innovation across Europe and around the world, and to consistently be one of the largest taxpayers in the world. The European Commission is trying to retroactively change the rules and ignore that, as required by international tax law, our income was already subject to taxes in the US. We are disappointed with today’s decision as previously the General Court reviewed the facts and categorically annulled this case."</p><p>Apple further noted that it has paid more than $20 billion in tax to the United States on the same profits the EU claims should be taxed in Ireland. Apple says that between 2003 and 2014, the decade scrutinized by the EU, the company paid $577 million in tax to Irish Revenue, 12.5% of the profits it generated in the country. </p>

                                                                                                                <dc:content><![CDATA[ <p>If you&apos;re buying a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16</a> model in the US, it&apos;ll come without a SIM card tray, and you&apos;ll need to switch to an eSIM – as is the new Apple norm. But if you&apos;re picking one up anywhere else, you&apos;ll still get a device with the tray.</p><p>Ever since the iPhone 14, Apple has been nudging the US toward a SIM-free existence. The latest <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-iphone">best iPhone</a> doesn&apos;t come with a SIM card tray, but that isn&apos;t the case anywhere else. In fact, the US iPhone 16 models have different model numbers, indicating that they&apos;re the odd ones out. It still seems weird, as eSIMs are used all over the world. I&apos;ve been using an eSIM since 2020 in the UK, even on devices with a SIM card tray.</p><p>But the SIM card tray isn&apos;t the only difference to US and non-US iPhone 16s. All iPhone 16 models outside of the US lack support for 5G mmWave. This tech promises blistering download speeds, but only if you&apos;re standing on top of a 5G tower in the middle of an open field. 5G mmWave has been a mixed bag, so this isn&apos;t a particular loss for anyone. But, it still seems odd for Apple to continue to only add it to US iPhone models.</p>
<h2 id="esims-are-still-supported-2">eSIMs are still supported</h2>
<p>While it sounds inconvenient at face value, removing the SIM card tray and switching to eSIM can actually be highly beneficial to iPhone users. Notably, you can use up to eight eSIMs on your device, so you can have multiple numbers and networks support on one device. This is particularly useful if you travel frequently to different countries, or you are Walter White. You can swap your number and network without removing your SIM card, and gone are the days of losing that pesky SIM pin you need to pop the tray open. </p><p>Removing the SIM card tray also makes manufacturing the iPhone easier for Apple, saving time and money, and it&apos;s one less port for water and dust ingress, keeping your iPhone&apos;s internals safer and sounder.</p><p>Fortunately, you can still use eSIMs on any recent iPhone model with a SIM tray. So, you&apos;ve got the option to go fully digital if you wish.</p>

I also used to be the person that owned the MacBook Pro, Apple Watch Ultra (not technically Pro but you know what I mean), the AirPods Pro, the iPad Pro — if Apple slapped a Pro on the name, that was the one I was buying.</p><p>However, over the years, the regular versions of Apple&apos;s products started to gain a lot of the features of the Pro versions. First came the 6th generation iPad mini, which won me over as a reading device. Then came the M2 MacBook Air, which pulled me away from my Intel MacBook Pro.</p><p>Today, after announcing the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16</a>, I think Apple is getting me to admit that I&apos;m no longer what the company would consider a "Pro" user.</p>
<h2 id="i-apos-m-downgrading-in-name-only-2">I&apos;m downgrading in name only</h2>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="oaH5bsCUBH6wMMxxbk9QFR" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 19.36.46.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/oaH5bsCUBH6wMMxxbk9QFR.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>After seeing all of the features announced with the iPhone 16 — Apple Intelligence, the Camera Capture button, the Action Button, and the camera features — I realized that the features offered in the iPhone 16 Pro like Pro Motion, the Always On display, and the even more insane camera features weren&apos;t things I would actually use or feel justified in spending the extra $200.</p><p>The iPhone 16 is great. I actually prefer how Aluminum holds up to smudges to Titanium as my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-15/iphone-15-pro-review">iPhone 15 Pro</a> has gotten smudgy all over the sides. The regular iPhone is also smaller and lighter, two things I appreciate having loved the iPhone 13 mini. I&apos;m also not a photographer or videographer who is ever going to come close to using the features that the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/apples-iphone-16-pro-is-here">iPhone 16 Pro</a> camera system packs in.</p><p>So, while I plan to downgrade in name and features, switching from a Pro iPhone to a regular iPhone is actually going to feel like a bit of an upgrade to me. I&apos;ll save money and get a phone that is better tailored for what I use it for. I&apos;ll also feel less anxious about smashing it to bits since it is slightly less premium.</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="vdrfFqpsh5orRyb3SuFhc4" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 18.43.19.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/vdrfFqpsh5orRyb3SuFhc4.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>The iPhone 16 isn&apos;t the only place I&apos;m thinking of downgrading from a Pro. I&apos;m also considering downgrading from the Apple Watch Ultra 2 to the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a>. It&apos;s once again a case of getting almost all of the features that matter to me in a more affordable and lighter option — things that I appreciate.</p><p>After next week, it could be that the only Pro Apple product I retain are the AirPods Pro. While Apple did come out with <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a> and bring noise cancellation to the regular earbuds, it appears that the noise cancellation on the AirPods Pro 2 are still much better. As someone who uses my AirPods Pro 2 on the plane to cut out engine noise (and boy are they good at it), I think I&apos;ll stick with them for now.</p><p>Other than that, however, I think it&apos;s time to admit that I&apos;m no longer a Pro user, and that&apos;s just fine.</p>

At the event, Tim Cook and the team announced the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/apples-iphone-16-pro-is-here">iPhone 16 Pro</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a>, <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a>, and more.</p><p>Whether you missed the prerecorded stream or just want to watch everything all over again, there are a number of ways to do so.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-rewatch-apple-apos-s-quot-it-apos-s-glowtime-quot-event-2">How to rewatch Apple&apos;s "It&apos;s Glowtime" event</h2>
<p>One way to re-watch today&apos;s special event is through the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/how-use-tv-app-apple-tv">Apple TV app</a>. The Apple TV app is <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.apple.com/apple-tv-app/devices/#mn_p">available on a ton of devices</a>, so you should be able to tune in on many of your favorite streaming devices, including the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/best-macbook">best MacBook</a> to enjoy the event all over again in 4K quality. You can re-watch the "It&apos;s Glowtime" special event on the Apple TV app by searching for Apple Event or asking Siri to "watch the Apple Event."</p><p>Another way to re-watch the special event is through YouTube. Apple has been streaming all of its live events on YouTube for a few years now and is nice enough to keep the events on its official YouTube channel for years after they occur.</p><p>You can watch Apple&apos;s "It&apos;s Glowtime" event on YouTube below:</p>

<p>While it might not be the first place you think of, Apple does drop its live events into a feed on Apple Podcasts as well. It&apos;s not a bad way to watch if you want to turn it on, tuck your iPhone in your pocket, and listen to the audio of the event. You can watch the special event on Apple Podcasts app at the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-events-video/id275834665">Apple Events</a> area.</p><p>The last way to re-watch the Apple Event is through the Apple Events website. Apple, in addition to all of the other outlets, always makes its events available to re-watch on its website in case you don&apos;t have access to the others.</p><p>You can re-watch the special event on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://apple.sjv.io/c/221109/473657/7613?subId1=UUimUdUnU81998&subId2=dim&u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.apple.com%2Fapple-events%2F">Apple Events website</a>.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-x-everything-you-need-to-know" target="_blank">Apple Watch Series 10</a> is an impressive new device, but it&apos;s a little bitter-sweet. My expectations were high, with years of Apple Watch X rumors. While I&apos;m a fan of the device we got, I&apos;m yearning for what could have been.</p><p>Apple&apos;s latest smartwatch comes packing the new S10 chipset and a larger wide-angle OLED display for brighter off-angle viewing. We always get a new chipset, so that&apos;s nothing special, but I like the better viewing angles. Apple also says that the display on the Series 10 is bigger than the one on the <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ultra-2-unveiled-at-september-iphone-event">Apple Watch Ultra 2</a>. I&apos;m a huge fan of that, seeing as I&apos;ve currently got the Apple Watch Ultra on my wrist. Like previous devices, it&apos;s available in two sizes: 42MM and 46MM.</p><p>You can now play media out of the speaker, and there&apos;s all-new Sleep Apnea detection. A new Titanium model replaces Stainless Steel, offered in natural, gold, or dark slate. Unfortunately, there&apos;s no brushed titanium option for the Series 10 – so I still prefer the design of the Apple Watch Ultra better.</p>

<p>Speaking of the Apple Watch Ultra, we didn&apos;t gen a new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/apple-watch-ultra-2-unveiled-at-september-iphone-event">third-gen model</a>. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is staying, but now comes in a Satin Black finish. While I&apos;ve been excited about this new color since we first heard rumors about it, I&apos;ve grown more fondly of titanium recently. I&apos;ll be sticking with the original color option, but am still glad to see the Black edition make its debut.</p><p>There&apos;s also a new range of Milanese bands to compliment this new shade. I instantly fell in love with these, and will be getting one immediately. Having always been a fan of titanium bands and Milanese straps, this option is perfect for me.</p>

<p>The <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-16/official-apple-unveils-iphone-16-which-is-designed-from-the-ground-up-for-apple-intelligence">iPhone 16 line</a> introduces several upgrades over the iPhone 15, such as the Action Button and a new "Camera Control" button that enables users to take photos and videos instantly. It can determine between a light and a hard press, as it&apos;s a haptic button. For example, a light press will show you a preview; or you can press harder for additional controls.</p><p>I&apos;m a little torn over this button. On the one hand, it&apos;ll make controlling the camera easier, and I&apos;ve been missing the quick camera launch after mapping my <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/iphone/iphone-15/iphone-15-pro-action-button-will-finally-make-ios-shortcuts-make-sense">Action Button</a> to Arc Search. But on the other, it&apos;s yet another button to get used to, and doesn&apos;t do anything the Camera app doesn&apos;t already offer. I think that I&apos;ll have to wait until my new iPhone arrives to make my mind up on this one.</p><p>New camera updates add a 48MP snapper here, with the promise of better aperture and snappier photos. The ability to record Spatial Video or take Spatial Photos is impressive for a non-Pro device, but I have no use for this without an <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/vision-pro/apple-vision-pro-review">Apple Vision Pro</a> headset. Also, the new camera bump layout gives me major WALL-E vibes.</p>

<p>iPhone 16 also comes with 8GB of memory and an A18 chip, enabling Apple Intelligence when it&apos;s made available later this year in iOS 18.1. The decision to continue offering 128GB base storage is infuriating, but to be expected as a way to differentiate from the Pro models.</p><p>This year&apos;s selection of colors certainly makes a statement. The new iPhone 16 is certainly a lot bolder than the iPhone 15&apos;s muted pastel colors – something many fans criticised. The new flagship Ultramarine blue color is my personal favorite, and the option I&apos;d pick</p>
<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="WBHe2Svfs9kW2Bkv3DsUTU" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 19.15.33.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WBHe2Svfs9kW2Bkv3DsUTU.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>But the iPhone 16 Pro Max (and smaller sibling) is where my particular focus is, being the device I&apos;m going to buy this year – upgrading from the iPhone 15 Pro Max.</p><p>Screen sizes have seen an increase from 6.1 and 6.7 inches to 6.3 and 6.9 inches, respectively. Wider bezels mean that the devices aren&apos;t actually any bigger than before. Since I&apos;ve always opted for the Pro Max for the extra screen real estate, this move is something I&apos;m very fond of – I&apos;m getting more iPhone screen without the device starting to get too big.</p><p>There&apos;s also a new Desert Titanium color, replacing Blue Titanium from last year. I initially ordered my iPhone 15 Pro Max in Blue Titanium, but quickly switched to the Natural Titanium to match my Apple Watch Ultra – a decision I&apos;m glad I made. But the new Desert Titanium is tempting me, which is a hot take. Most are criticising the color, but I&apos;m actually rather fond. I said what I said.</p><p>The fact that both main cameras are now 48MP is better, as I take thousands of photos on my iPhone each month. I&apos;m excited to see the faster aperture speed for snappier shots, and how much brighter photos are. While I&apos;ve been using the 5x tetraprism camera for a year now, I am glad it&apos;s now available on the smaller iPhone 16 Pro – it should have been from the beginning. Also, 4K Slo-Mo at 120fps is technically very impressive, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve ever recorded in slow motion. Ever.</p><p>I won&apos;t rehash my thoughts on the Camera Control button or any other features that are identical to the regular iPhone 16 devices. Although I will say that I&apos;m glad pricing has remained where it is.</p>

<p>As for the new AirPods, my feelings are a little mixed. The new <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a> offer a more comfortable design, new case Find My features, and wireless charging. And (plot twist) there are two variants: one with ANC and one without.</p><p>I&apos;m very glad to see the new $129 AirPods 4, and I think this model makes sense (in theory). $179 is still a little steep for the cheapest AirPods in a world where decent wireless earbuds can be had for around $50. While $129 is still pricier, it makes AirPods much more accessible for those that don&apos;t care about the latest and greatest features.</p><p>But (and this is a big but), the AirPods line-up is now far too confusing. AirPods 4 have the same name, but one has ANC and is $179 while the other has no noise cancellation and is $129. AirPods Pro 2 can now be had in three configurations: Lightning case, MagSafe and USB-C case, and USB-C case with the new hearing features. And then there&apos;s AirPods Max at the high end. Try explaining all that to your grandma or in less than 20 words.</p><p>Apple is using the same name for too many devices at once. The $129 AirPods 4 should be AirPods SE, while the $179 AirPods 4 should maintain their 4th-gen name. As for the Pros, Apple should just slap a 3 on there already, as a third minor upgrade is dragging on a little. As for AirPods Max keeping their name, I&apos;ll allow it since the only changes are USB-C and colors – but next time must add a number on there.</p><p>Rant over. I like the fact that Find My is now on AirPods 4 – a must-have feature that&apos;s come to my rescue a fair few times. I like the new AirPods Max colors, and I&apos;m sure many fans will too. Although I&apos;m disappointed, there aren&apos;t any audio improvements to Apple&apos;s expensive and premium over-ear cans. AirPods Pro 2 (v3)&apos;s new hearing features look really useful, and I&apos;m excited to try them out. But. Call. Them. AirPods. Pro. 3. For. The. Love. Of. God. Please.</p>
<h2 id="my-thoughts-on-the-newest-apple-devices-summarised-2">My thoughts on the newest Apple devices summarised</h2>
<p>The Apple Watch Series 10 and iPhone 16 line bring solid upgrades like a larger OLED display and the anticipated S10 chip for the watch, and enhanced camera systems for the iPhones. But across the board, Apple&apos;s newest devices are somewhat bittersweet.</p><p>The Apple Watch Series didn&apos;t quite live up to the buzz of Apple Watch X rumors, leaving a sense of "what could have been," and the confusing AirPods line-up with identical names, but different features adds unnecessary complexity. Still, some new features like Find My for AirPods and sleep apnea detection for the Watch stand out.</p><p>All in all, I&apos;m a happy camper. The new releases bring a mix of excitement and mild frustration, but overall offer compelling new features that are welcoming to see.</p>

The process allows you to check your eligibility, choose the iPhone model and configuration you want, confirm your upgrade with your carrier, and get pre-approved for the iPhone Upgrade Program.</p><p>Going through this process gives you a noticeable advantage over others who try to complete all of these steps when the iPhone 16 and iPhone 16 Pro goes live for preorders at 5:00 AM PDT on Friday, September 13th (spooky). Those who complete this process are able to log in at that time, confirm their order, and keep moving about their day.</p>

<figure class="van-image-figure  inline-layout" data-bordeaux-image-check ><div class='image-full-width-wrapper'><div class='image-widthsetter' style="max-width:1498px;"><p class="vanilla-image-block" style="padding-top:56.07%;"><img id="xar9CMPGkNbCDmYiXUHhqN" name="Screenshot 2024-09-09 at 19.36.20.png" alt="Glowtime 2024" src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/xar9CMPGkNbCDmYiXUHhqN.png" mos="" align="middle" fullscreen="" width="1498" height="840" attribution="" endorsement="" class=""></p></div></div><figcaption itemprop="caption description" class=" inline-layout"><span class="credit" itemprop="copyrightHolder">(Image credit: Apple)</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>Trying to complete all of these steps when preorders go live could set you up for delayed shipping if enough people get their preorders in before you. It&apos;s always a mad dash to grab the exact iPhone you want and you are competing with potentially millions of other people, so make sure to give yourself every advantage.</p><p>The nice thing about this program is that you can still change up your iPhone up to the point of preorders going live — you&apos;ll just need to go through the pre-approval process for the loan again. You can also still choose to either ship your iPhone to your home or pick it up from your local Apple Store.</p><p>You can get pre-approved for your iPhone 16 and the iPhone 16 Pro on the iPhone Upgrade Program through the Apple Store app or on the Apple Store website.</p>

There&apos;s a new Camera Control on the new iPhones, which gives better access to taking photos and videos. The screens across the line-up are better than ever, and more durable. Apple is showing a fondness for new colors this year, with plenty of options to pick from.</p><p><a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/health-fitness/apple-watch/forget-the-x-apple-watch-series-10-unveiled">Apple Watch Series 10</a> was a big upgrade, with a bigger screen than ever before. The body is the slimmest it&apos;s ever been, things are faster on the inside, and moves the antennas to the backside of the case. Apple Watch Ultra 2 got a new colour option, and a third-gen Apple Watch SE never materialized.</p><p>AirPods also saw some big changes. <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" href="https://www.imore.com/airpods/apple-announces-brand-new-airpods-4-and-theyre-more-like-the-pros-than-ever">AirPods 4</a> gain active noise cancellation, and launch an even cheaper $129 model without ANC. AirPods Max get a minor refresh with USB-C and new colours, while AirPods Pro 2 got a third iteration with new hearing tech added.</p><p>But the latest Apple event doesn&apos;t just mark the beginning of Apple&apos;s latest devices; it also marks the end for a bunch of products.</p>
<h2 id="every-apple-product-discontinued-after-the-iphone-16-event-2">Every Apple product discontinued after the iPhone 16 event</h2>
<p>While everybody&apos;s attention has been on everything announced at the iPhone 16 event, I&apos;ve been diving in to the products Apple discontinued after the event. Here&apos;s everything I&apos;ve found so far:</p>
<ul><li>iPhone 15 Pro</li><li>iPhone 15 Pro Max</li><li>AirPods (2nd-generation)</li><li>AirPods (3rd-generation)</li><li>Apple Watch Series 9</li><li>iPhone 13</li><li>iPhone 13 mini</li><li>FineWoven iPhone 16 cases (so far)</li></ul>
<p>While an online Target listing made us think Apple&apos;s wired EarPods might be on the way out, they&apos;re still available on Apple&apos;s store for now. Those that prefer wires can enjoy $19 earphones from Apple for a while longer.</p><p>As I find more Apple products discontinued after the iPhone 16 event, we&apos;ll update this list.</p>
